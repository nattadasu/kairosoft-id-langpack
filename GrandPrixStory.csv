"#00418","In this simulation game, you take control of a racing team. Hire talented drivers, develop new vehicles, and enter Grand Prix races as you try to become the best in the world."
,"▼Game Flow<br>Give instructions to your drivers and mechanics to have them train or develop new vehicles. Use your vehicles to enter races and win prize money."
,"▼Developing Vehicles<br>First select a vehicle and drive type. Depending on the group's Tech and the rank of that vehicle type, you may get more performance than the plans show."
,"▼Installing Parts<br>Installing parts in a vehicle will change its performance. The skill of the group doing the installation and the rank of the part also affect performance."
,"▼Research Data<br>Research Data can be used to upgrade vehicles or parts, or unlock new ones. You can get Research Data during races or by scrapping vehicles."
,"▼Scrapping Vehicles<br>Used vehicles have Research Data inside them. If you scrap a vehicle, it will disappear, but you will get a large amount of Research Data."
,"▼Vehicle Attributes 1<br>■ Durability - A vehicle's Durability goes down as it races, especially if it hits something or goes very fast. When it reaches 0, the vehicle will break."
,"▼Vehicle Attributes 2<br>■ Speed - Top speed.<br>■ Acceleration - Acceleration ability.<br>■ Handling - Lets you turn at high speeds."
,"▼Vehicle Attributes 3<br>■ Expansion - Number of part slots.<br>■ Appeal - Affects the effectiveness of a sponsor's advertising when used on that vehicle."
,"▼Vehicle Attributes 4<br>■ Repair - Affects repair time.<br>■ On-Road - Affects performance when on paved roads."
,"▼Vehicle Attributes 5<br>■ Off-Road - Affects performance when on grass or dirt roads.<br>■ Icy Road - Affects performance when on icy roads."
,"▼Groups<br>A group consists of a driver and multiple mechanics. The group's Appeal, Tech, and Analysis attributes are calculated based on its members' attributes."
,"▼Drivers<br>Drivers help to bring out a vehicle's true performance. Their abilities can be improved with training. If a driver does well in races, their contract renewal fee will rise."
,"▼Driver Attributes 1<br>■Pedal - Increases vehicle top speed.<br>■Shift - Increases vehicle acceleration.<br>■Steer - Increases ease of turns."
,"▼Driver Attributes 2<br>■Appeal - Increases sponsor ad effect.<br>■Tech - Affects vehicle development and speeds up repairs."
,"▼Driver Attributes 3<br>■Analysis - The higher this attribute, the more Research Data a vehicle will accumulate."
,"▼Mechanics 1<br>Mechanics have 3 attributes: Tech, Appeal, and Analysis. They raise the attributes of their group. Unlike drivers, mechanics are paid monthly."
,"▼Mechanics 2<br>You can use Research Data to increase the level of your mechanics, up to a maximum of Level 5."
,"▼Research and Upgrading 1<br>As you play, you will be able to research and develop new vehicles and parts. You can also use Research Data to upgrade vehicles and parts."
,"▼Research and Upgrading 2<br>A group with high Tech will get better results when upgrading. Mechanics may also find Research Data or gain attributes during the upgrading process."
,"▼Sponsors 1<br>When you sign a contract with a sponsor, you will get a sponsorship payment twice a year. If you do well in races, you may get a bonus."
,"▼Sponsors 2<br>The sponsor's rating will also increase. If their gauge fills up, you'll get a special reward, and their ☆ will turn into a ★."
,"▼Entering Races<br>There are two kinds of races: Single and Grand Prix races. Single races are one-offs, while GPs have multiple races. You can enter both at once."
,"▼Grand Prix 1<br>When you enter a GP, races will be periodically held. After each race, you are given points based on your rank. The final winner is the team with the most points."
,"▼Grand Prix 2<br>Once you win a GP, you'll be able to enter the next category of race."
,"▼Race: Qualifying<br>Before the real race, you compete in a qualifying race to decide your starting order. A driver's attributes can give bonuses to vehicle performance."
,"▼Race: Racing<br>All cars race for the finish line. You may find Research Data during a race. If your vehicle's Durability reaches 0, you will have to withdraw."
,"▼Race: Results<br>If you have a sponsorship contract, your advertising effectiveness will be calculated. Your vehicle and parts will get experience, according to your rank."
,"▼Tips for Winning<br>Training your mechanics to increase their Tech will improve the performance of vehicles and parts. The timing for using aura is also very important."
,"▼Ending<br>The game ""ends"" at the end of March in the 14th year. Your funds and Clear Points will be used to calculate your score. But you can keep playing for as long as you want."
,"▼Other<br>Some of your attributes at the end of the game can be carried over to the next game, making it easier to get a high score. You may also discover some secret characters..."

Of course, it's too much to expect to win your first race, and in fact they came in toward the rear of the pack. But their refusal to give up showed determination that we liked. The editors here hope they won't let this initial setback get to them. We're rooting for you, <co=0066cc><name></co>!"
"#00423","Newcomer <co=0066cc><name></co> recently took part in their first race--the <co=0066cc><0></co>. They got off to an impressive start, taking their opponents by surprise and coming in first! A spectator commented excitedly that he got chills down his spine as they passed by, and we felt much the same way as we watched. Perhaps this signals the arrival of a new world-class racing team. We'll be watching their next race very closely."
"#00424","We recently interviewed someone working as an engineer for a famous racing team. ""Drivers are important,"" he said. ""But it's the vehicle itself that's turning those wheels. Upgrades and research can't be underestimated. When my team started out, we didn't have much of a choice of vehicles, but we kept researching and developing new ones until we got to where we are today."""
"#00425","<co=0066cc><name><co=0000d4> </co>recently won the<co=0000d4> <co=0066cc><0><co=0000d4> </co>for the first time. Given the team's impressive talent, this was probably just a matter of time, but now it's official. ""At the end I was just praying that we'd finish safely,"" said one of the team members tearfully. ""I really have to give credit to the driver."" Apparently the team had a well-deserved celebration at a nearby restaurant that night. We look forward to hearing more from them."
"#00426","After a hard-fought contest, <co=0000d4><name></co> came in first overall in this year's Formula Smile. ""They've really grown a lot,"" said one of their fans, dressed in a team t-shirt. ""Both in terms of their vehicles, and as a team."" Rumor has it that their next stop may be a Grand Prix in Asia. We'll be watching!"
"#00427","It's official: <co=0000d4><name></co> has won the Formula Asia GP! We have been following their progress from the beginning and couldn't be happier with this news. This may be just the stepping stone they need to take their place on the world stage. As you might expect of a world-class team, we hear that they never fail to analyze their performance after every race."
"#00428","According to information we've just received, <co=0000d4><name></co> has won this year's Formula No. One! We've been watching them from the start, and can't help but be overcome with joy at this news. But racing is a surprisingly deep sport, so their real trials may have only just begun. We wish them nothing but the best in the future."
"#00429","We've just received word that <co=0000d4><name></co> has just landed their first sponsorship contract. Sponsors have been known to give bonuses and other gifts when they are pleased with their team's performance. Some have even given rare and valuable parts, so working with a variety of sponsors may be a shortcut to victory."
"#00430","<co=0000d4><name></co> recently revealed that they will be taking part in <co=0000d4>Formula Smile</co>, so let's briefly review the rules. When a team enters a Grand Prix, they will periodically take part in races, getting points for how well they do. Once all of the races are over, the team with the highest number of points will be crowned the world champion, and be able to enter even higher ranked GPs. We talked to an ex-racer who competed in Formula Smile. ""You're doing one race after another,"" he said. ""So if you only have one vehicle and it breaks down, you're sunk. It's better to have a spare and alternate them. We also used different vehicles depending on the circuit we were in, which is one reason we did so well."" That's sound advice for anyone attempting to win a Grand Prix."
"#00431","We've just heard that <name>'s vehicle exploded while competing in the <0>. ""It just wasn't durable enough,"" said the head of the investigatory committee. ""It's important to perform frequent repairs, but this might have been avoided if the vehicle had been more durable."" Since a Grand Prix involves back-to-back races, improving the repair skills of your mechanics is definitely a good choice."
"#00432","<name> has just debuted their second car! One of the many fans on hand to witness the event commented, ""Now the team can stand should-to-shoulder with any of the world-class teams. I wish I could take a ride in it myself!"" We look forward to seeing the new vehicle in action."
"#00433","As this reporter was taking a stroll earlier today, I just happened to see what appeared to be the development of a new vehicle at the <co=0066cc><name></co> garage. One of the mechanics who agreed to talk to me said, ""We're putting all of our know-how into this one. It'll be amazing! Hey, this is off the record, right?"" Oops, I guess I wasn't supposed to publish that, but what's done is done. I can hardly wait to see what they've come up with."
"#00434","We've just been told that <co=0000d4><name> </co>has succeeded in upgrading some of their parts.<br><br>The leader of one of the rival teams expressed his surprise: ""I guess their mechanics are better than they look. We'll have to keep an eye on them in future races.""<br><br>Indeed, all eyes will be on this up-and-coming team to see what they have up their collective sleeves."
"#00435","Rumor has it that <co=0000d4><name></co> has been invited to compete in a world-famous race on Chimp Island. The invitation reads, in part: ""We've been watching you for a long time and would love to have you visit our island. Chimp Island: Come for the racing, stay for the bananas."" From what we understand, racing is wildly popular on Chimp Island, eclipsed only by napping and grooming family members."
"#00436","Word is that <co=0000d4><name></co> has been invited to race in Kairoland, a mysterious island only recently discovered. While we were incredulous at first, we have received a copy of the invitation from ""Mister X,"" which reads in part: ""I saw you race on Chimp Island and was quite impressed. I'll prepare a suitable opponent for you, so please come. Heh heh..."" Yes, he actually wrote, ""Heh heh"" on the invitation. In any case, the new circuit apparently has some surprises in store..."
