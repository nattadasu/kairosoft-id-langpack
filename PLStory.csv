,"(About This Game)"
"#00244","A New Team is Born!"
"#00245","There's a new soccer team on the block: the <0>. The new team, which is in an area somewhat removed from the bustle of the big city, is enjoying the support of the local residents.<br><br>""I hope this will be a boost to the economy,"" said a local cheese maker. ""Business has stunk recently."" We will definitely be following this new team's progress with interest."
"#00246","Amateur Champs!"
"#00247","The <0> have emerged as the Amateur League champions. Word of this newly formed team's victory has spread like wildfire in the soccer world, suddenly propelling the <0> into fame.<br><br>Managers of other leagues are already in talks with the <0> in hopes of having them join. We'll be keeping an eye on this promising team in the future."
"#00248","Regional Champs!"
"#00249","The <0> are the new Regional League champions, having impressively defeated their opponents. Next they will be moving on to the big time: the National League. Let's hope that their luck holds out on the national stage.<br><br>The other teams in the league have wasted no time in checking out their new rival. Even a reporter from our magazine found himself being grilled by various coaches attempting to get information. They will no doubt be using this info to come up with a strategy to use against the newcomers. We wish the <0> luck. They'll need it."
"#00250","National Champs!"
"#00251","The recently formed soccer team, the <0>, has emerged victorious against all of their rivals in the National League, taking their first championship. The assistant coach couldn't hide her tears. ""We all worked so hard to get here,"" she said. ""But nobody has worked harder than our team's owner.""<br>Rumor has it that this victory has brought the <0> to the attention of league managers around the world. They certainly have our respect and congratulations. Well done!"
"#00252","Year-End Worries"
"#00253","It's the end of the year, and that means that players are stressing out over whether or not their contract will be renewed. And since coaches' contracts get renewed at the same time, it can be a difficult time for team management as they try to come up with some kind of strategy for the upcoming season. Coaches come into their own as their team practices, giving them experience points and sometimes discovering new Formations. And coaches also affect the amount of Research Points a team gets after a game. Yes, a team's choice of coaches can greatly affect their performance. We've also heard that coaches who get their contracts renewed get more in tune with their team, allowing them to go up in level. It's always fascinating to see the choices that teams make as they prepare to compete."
"#00254","Aura Awes"
"#00255","Are you familiar with Auras? When a player is knocked down during a match, their Aura Gauge will go up. If a player plays with a full Aura Gauge, their performance will be improved. ""There's a limit to how long an Aura can be used,"" said renowned soccer commentator Ray Rudson. ""It's probably most effective to use an Aura at the beginning of a match."""
"#00256","Formations"
"#00257","Many think that Formations are one of the more interesting aspects of soccer. Part of coming up with a strategy is experimenting to see which Formations work best.<br><br>Some prefer to tailor their Formations to their opponents, choosing a more defensive stance when facing an aggressive team, and opting for an offensive strategy when facing a team that plays more conservatively."
"#00258","Player Stats"
"#00259","Some players say that building up your Body is the key to success, while others claim that if you increase your Speed, no one will be able to touch you. While it's easy to assume that upgrading a players Kick stat will lead to more goals, having a more balanced approach is usually best. Deciding how to best train your players is any coach's biggest problem."
"#00260","Team Facilities"
"#00261","One barometer of a team's abilities is the condition of its facilities. When players use their facilities, they get Research Points, and can build up Auras and other stats as well. And don't forget that facilities themselves can also be upgraded, speeding up players' progress.<br><br>Someday a team from our humble country will build a truly world-class set of facilities. We hope that day comes soon."
"#00262","Practice Strats"
"#00263","Players' development can vary greatly depending on whether they practice as a team or continue to use their team's facilities. And that decision is up to the team's coach and owner. Consulting with the coach to come up with a good practice strategy is one of the team owner's primary duties."
"#00264","Pay Up!"
"#00265","If you're having trouble making ends meet at your team, you've probably noticed that players get paid each time they play in a match. Players who don't play don't get paid, so if times are hard you can try removing higher-paid players from your lineup.<br><br>But we've also heard that some teams try to sign as many players as possible in order to earn a lot of Research Points. What do you think the best way to earn points is?"
"#00266","A Small Step"
"#00267","We wrote about the <0> earlier, and now it seems that they've had their first victory.<br><br>""I can't say that it was a perfect match from the fans' perspective. We still need to work on making it more exciting, but it's a start,"" said the team owner. We look forward to further developments from the <0>."
"#00268","10 Wins Already!"
"#00269","The <0> are on a roll, having just achieved their 10th victory. Observers are astonished that a newly formed team is doing so well.<br>""If we're not careful, the <0> will be the team to beat in the future,"" said the coach of a competing team. Indeed, we're very interested in how the <0> do from now on."
"#00270","50-Win Wonder"
"#00271","This must be some kind of record. The <0> has racked up 50 wins in the short time since the team was formed. While many teams are facing hard times, these newcomers have managed to find their groove.<br><br>""Our local team is getting recognition around the country. Nothing could make us prouder,"" said one happy fan."
"#00272","5,000 Fans!"
"#00273","The <0>'s fan base has reached 5,000. The team's steady victories have attracted new fans, as has their aggressive use of fan service events targeting local residents. They say that a team is only as strong as its fan base, and we hope that they'll take that saying to heart."
"#00274","100,000 Fans!"
"#00275","The <0> are making a name for themselves worldwide, and have just recently surpassed 100,000 fans across the globe. Of course their fan base here in their home country is quite large as well, making them the most popular team here.<br><br>""We may have a lot of fans, but it's still not enough,"" said the president of their fan club. ""Our team needs our support! A team's fans are its power!"""
"#00276","Baring it All"
"#00277","The Palmgreasers recently attempted to play a match in their underwear, prompting a hurried meeting by Soccer Association officials. In the end, this and other violations led to their expulsion from the league--an unprecedented occurrence.<br><br>""We just don't like being constrained by uniforms,"" said a team representative in his tighty-whities. ""But we all got our sponsor's logo tattooed on our chests. That hurt!""<br><br>The team is no doubt going through an entirely different kind of pain now that they're out of the league."
"#00278","Player Positions"
"#00279","We recently conducted an informal survey of soccer coaches, asking how they decide which players to use in what position. Most said that they didn't have any hard and fast rules, and instead made decisions based on their gut feelings.<br><br>While it's true that some players are best suited to particular positions, don't forget that you can put any player in any position. Indeed, one famous coach commented that you're better off evaluating a player's relative skill in an area, rather than looking at things in black and white. We hope this tip will be useful for you as you design your team."
