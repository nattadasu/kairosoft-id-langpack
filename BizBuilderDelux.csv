"#01163","Year number 20 is about to end."
"#01164","Too bad... That store has been shut down."
"#01165","You seem to have enough manager-class employees."
,"Try again after dismissing one of your current managers."
"#01166","I see... That's too bad, but I understand."
,"I'll start the procedures for shutting the store down, then."
"#01167","Boss! Now we don't have any stores..."
"#01168","Let's try again! I'm sure we can make a great store!"
"#01169","You don't seem to have a store..."
"#01170","Welcome!"
"#01171","Thank you!"
"#01172","Not enough funds..."
"#01173","Not enough hearts..."
"#01174","Not enough coins..."
"#01175","Not enough points..."
"#01176","Hmm... We don't seem to have enough left in the budget."
,"Let's look into it <co=0066cc>when next year's budget comes out</co>."
"#01177","Uh-oh... You don't have anything that you can sell."
,"Goods for sale will be refreshed in a few months."
"#01178","Oh, you don't seem to have anything that I can buy. Feel free to try again later."
"#01179","You don't seem to have any items."
"#01180","You put <0> in charge of the store."
,"It will be run as an ""auto-pilot store"" from now on. I'm sure it'll work out well!"
"#01181","This is a big responsibility!"
,"I'll return the staff who had been working here to you."
,"I'll do my very best to increase sales!"
"#01182","I understand..."
,"I'll return the staff who had been working here to you."
,"I'll work my hardest!"
"#01183","Understood!"
,"I'll return the staff who had been working here to you."
,"You can look forward to big things from me--and big sales!"
"#01184","Boss!"
,"I found some part-time staff who may fit the bill!"
"#01185","Thank you! I'll be the best part-time worker you've ever seen!"
"#01186","R-Really...? You're hiring me?!"
,"This is a dream come true! I'll work really hard--I promise!"
"#01187","I'll work my fingers to the bone! Well, maybe not. But I will work hard!"
,"I can't wait to get started!"
"#01188","Boss!"
,"Somebody who says they used to run a rival store wants to talk to you!"
"#01189","I am humbled."
,"I'll make the most of my experience managing many different stores. I won't fail this time!"
"#01190","Thank you for hiring me!"
,"With my talent, your store is guaranteed to be a success!"
"#01191","Yes!"
,"I researched you thoroughly when I was your rival, so I should have a head start!"
"#01192","We're currently searching for new candidates."
,"Please wait a bit longer."
"#01193","What type of store would you like to manage?"
"#01194","Let's assign some staff to your new store."
"#01195","You're ready to open! Let's make this place a big success!"
"#01196","I tried assigning a staff member who was in the waiting room."
,"Try and keep a good balance between all of your stores."
"#01197","You don't have enough <co=0066cc>manager-class<co=993300> </co>staff members."

,"Let's take a look..."
"#01202","Wow! It was a success!"
"#01203","It looks like it failed..."
,"Too bad. We'll have to try again."
"#01204","It looks like this location isn't suitable. Try another."
"#01205","It's almost time for the mayoral election."
,"Who should we nominate as a candidate?"
"#01206","<0> has been elected the new mayor."
"#01207","Voting for the new mayor is about to begin!"
,"Let's all keep our fingers crossed for <0>."
"#01208","Gulp..."
,"I hope all of that hard work will pay off..."
"#01209","Unfortunately, it didn't work out..."
,"If only their stats were a bit higher, maybe they could've won..."
,"You can try again in the election 3 years from now!"
"#01210","You can't add any more."
"#01211","Leave it to me!"
"#01212","Hee hee! I'm ready!"
"#01213","I'm looking forward to it!"
"#01214","Awesome! I can't wait!"
"#01215","You made the right choice!"
"#01216","Choose the participants!"
"#01217","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"For a while, this should make it easier to build a facility like a new <1>!"
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01218","I see..."
,"We'll discuss stopping <1> construction at the next meeting."
"#01219","I see. Yes, that kind of introduction should be very effective."
,"We'll have a serious discussion about this at our next meeting."
"#01220","Talks with the facility to be introduced are now complete!"
,"You just have to select <co=0066cc>""Store"" > ""Introduce""</co> from the menu."
"#01221","I see! Everybody likes a good <0>..."
,"This should be a good chance to make a name for <town>!"
,"We'll start discussing it right away so we can put our name in the running!"
"#01222","It's time for the location for the <0> to be announced."
,"Let's go to the hall right now!"
"#01223","We had another successful <0> this year..."
,"And we would love for <town> to host us again next time!"
"#01224","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"That should increase our population."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01225","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"That should help increase land prices and let you open bigger stores."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01226","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"If customers have more spending money, it should help boost your sales."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01227","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"It should help our residents feel better about using your store."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01228","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"For a while, construction in town should go faster!"
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"

,"<1>-type facilities will evolve and be remodeled."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01230","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"The more tax income we get, the more the town's construction will advance."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01231","<0>? Good idea! It could contribute to the town's development!"
,"Reducing taxes will give customers more money to spend when shopping."
,"We'll start discussing it right away!"
"#01232","This policy requires a few more <0>-type facilities in town."
"#01233","Actually, ""<0>"" is currently in progress."
"#01234","Oops! To dismiss someone, they can't be performing research or on a treasure hunt."
"#01235","Oh dear!"
,"Store #<0> has been defeated by its rival..."
"#01236","We just got some information about a contest!"
"#01237","Congratulations on winning the <co=0066cc><0></co>!"
"#01238","Unfortunately, you lost..."

"#01239","Unfortunately, you lost..."
,"Try researching your products a bit more!"
"#01240","It's time to start remodeling."
,"Look forward to your brand-spanking new store!"
"#01241","Store #<0> has been remodeled."

"#01243","You don't seem to have any staff..."
"#01244","=#01197"
"#01245","You don't seem to have any staff."
"#01246","What's this...?"
,"You don't have a cash register in this store. The customers don't know how to pay!"
,"Let's place one right away!"
"#01247","By the way, boss..."
,"Have you thought about what to do about the museum's admission fee?"
,"It can be a very important source of income, so the right balance is key!"
,"You can change it by <co=0066cc>selecting the cash register</co>."
"#01248","To dismiss a manager-class staff member, you must first assign them to the waiting room."
"#01249","Actually, you seem to be pretty well staffed at the moment."
,"If you must search for new staff, you'll need to dismiss some first."
"#01250","Select a product to stock on the shelves."
"#01251","You don't have any products that can be stocked."
,"Performing research can sometimes lead to the discovery of new products."
"#01252","The new budget for <town> has been decided."
"#01253","Wow... This looks like a really comfortable room."
,"This should help me concentrate on my work!"
"#01254","Awesome! Now I can work without getting tired out!"
"#01255","Nice! I can't believe what a cool room this is!"
"#01256","Starting next month, the hours of all stores will be <co=0066cc><0>:00 to <2>:00</co>."

"#01260","Keep working on going up in rank!"
"#01261","<0> is currently performing research. You'll have to wait a bit."
"#01262","I've got this!"
"#01263","No problem!"
"#01264","I can't wait to get to work!"
"#01265","Congratulations on another year of hard work."
,"Here is the yearly report for <0>."
"#01266","Give badges to the staff members who worked hardest during the year!"
,"Badges really help staff members' future development, so choose wisely who to give them to."
"#01267","Give badges to the staff members who worked hardest during the year!"
"#01268","Now for the score announcement."
"#01269","After the 20th year, your online ranking high score will not be refreshed, and cannot be registered."
,"If you want to try for a high score, select ""New Game"" from the title screen!"
"#01270","Let's try to make even higher sales next year!"
"#01271","It looks like the cart is too small."
,"Try selecting a bigger cart if you want better effects."
"#01272","Your staff are out searching for treasure."
,"Please wait until they return."
"#01273","You don't seem to be ready to serve <0>."
,"Make sure you've placed the required <co=0066cc>cookware </co>and <co=0066cc>materials </co>in your back room."
"#01274","Select the type of materials."
"#01275","You are missing the following item: <0>."
"#01276","There are no customers you can target with ads now."
"#01277","Thanks for your business..."
,"The town has developed enough to unlock some new ad types. Give them a try!"
"#01278","You already have an ad in place. Please wait a bit."
"#01279","The ad has been placed."
,"Let's wait and see if it attracts anyone to the store!"
"#01280","Hmm... I came because of your ad, but..."
,"This just isn't quite the kind of store I'm looking for."
"#01281","Uh-oh. It looks like the target of our ad wasn't quite satisfied."
,"Increase the quality of the store's products and try again!"
"#01282","Boss!"
,"That ad must have been effective... A new customer is approaching the store!"
"#01283","The material was changed to <co=0066cc><0></co>."
"#01284","You changed the entrance fee."
,"Changes in entrance fees will be reflected next month."
"#01285","Boss! Let's keep at least one store going!"
"#01286","It seems like assigning one manager-class employee to each store works best."
,"Swap a manager for another to assign him or her to a different store."
"#01287","That manager has already been put in charge of another store."
"#01288","You can only manage up to <co=dd0806><0></co> stores at once."
,"To start another store, you must <co=dd0806>release one</co>. Select ""Store"" > ""Store Info"" from the menu."
,"The store you release will be changed into an ""auto-pilot"" store."
"#01289","You can have up to <co=dd0806><0></co> ""auto-pilot"" stores."
,"You may want to close down a store with low profits."
"#01290","You can't release a store that's less than 1 year old..."
"#01291","You don't have enough manager-class staff to run for mayor."
"#01292","They said they can't run in an election and manage a store at the same time."
,"Admirable sense of responsibility!"
"#01293","To refill your <co=0066cc><0><co=993300> </co>stock, you require ""<co=0066cc><1></co>"" materials."
,"Build a material depot in your back room to get ""<co=0066cc><1></co>"" materials."
"#01294","<0>'s growth type is already <1>."
"#01295","Changing <0>'s growth type..."

"#01296","This store doesn't deal in food."
"#01297","You don't have the rights to open a new store."
"#01298","To change to the next cart, you first need to put an item in the cart."
"#01299","You cannot place that, as you have reached the maximum <co=0066cc>furnishings cost</co>."

,"You might want to try a variety of different layouts."
"#01350","Boss!"
,"Without any <co=0066cc>cookware</co>, we won't be able to serve any food."

"#01351","You have to have at least 1 manager-class staff member!"
"#01352","Boss, I've been taking night classes at a business school."

,"Who'd have guessed, right? Let's get to it!"
"#01366","A new kind of <co=0066cc>locked furnishing</co> has been added to the menu for your new store."
,"It's nice to be able to build many different types of stores, isn't it?"
"#01367","So, you're going to be managing a bakery, huh?"
,"In a bakery, your staff will <co=0066cc>prepare the food in the kitchen<co=993300> </co>before putting it<co=993300> <co=0066cc>on the shelves</co>."
,"You'll want to pay close attention to both your shelves and the back room."
"#01368","Ah! I just love the idea of running a stand out in the fresh air!"
"#01369","So, you're starting your own museum, are you?"
,"You'll want to get some killer exhibits so you can make money on <co=0066cc>admission fees</co>!"
"#01370","A new <co=0066cc>locked furnishing</co> for the <co=0066cc>Game Store</co> has been added to the menu."

"#01379","That was great!"
,"I'm so glad I finally found the kind of store I've been looking for!"
,"Please take this <co=0066cc>research recipe </co>and <co=0066cc>item </co>with my thanks!"
,"I'm sure I'll be coming all the time from now on!"
"#01380","Boss..."
,"I've been thinking about that problem we had with money earlier..."
,"So I've been reading a lot of blogs to research management strategies."
,"It seems the quickest way to make a business profitable is to use <co=0066cc>research </co>to boost product prices."
,"By the way, I entered a contest on one of those blogs, and I won! Here, you take the prize money."
,"Just be sure you make good use of it!"
"#01381","Boss..."
,"A staff member left me a message when he heard about your shortage of hearts. Here's what he said."
,"""Customers coming in contact with ♪ from furnishings are more likely to leave hearts."""
,"""Lead them to attractive furnishings so they can get a lot of music notes and leave more hearts!"""
,"He also left these hearts for me to give to you."
"#01382","Boss..."
,"Running low on coins is tough. They're not easy to earn, are they?"
,"I've heard that if you beat your monthly profit record, you will get one coin."
,"It's not easy, but do your best to increase sales and you'll start earning coins!"
,"By the way, I found this when I was cleaning out my couch. Maybe you can put it to good use!"
"#01383","It seems that you didn't have enough stamina points for the last treasure hunt..."
,"Next time, choose heartier staff members and you'll have better luck!"
"#01384","I can't wait to see if those music notes have an effect on the customers!"
"#01385","It looks like you've got a place that's <co=dd0806>hard to get past</co>."
,"You'll want to move things around so customers can pass in front of the furnishings."
,"You might try <co=0066cc>moving it</co> to another location, or changing its orientation."
"#01386","Let's research a new dish!"
"#01387","It's not easy to find manager-class employees, is it?"
,"But if you keep managing your store, I'm sure you'll get some!"
"#01388","By the way, the sales of your ""auto-pilot stores""..."
,"...Are only announced once a year!"
"#01389","Boss!!!"
,"Have you seen this year's national store rankings?!"
,"We're number one!"
,"I've been working for this day for so long... I'm so proud to be your secretary right now!"
,"And we've even got some presents in honor of our achievement! Check them out later."
,"But let's not rest easy. There are still records to be broken!"
"#01390","Boss..."
,"You're really running low on money, aren't you?"
,"We may have to cut out our daily snacks!"
,"...But before we do anything that drastic, use this money that I found in the corner of the safe!"
,"Just be sure you make good use of it!"
"#01391","Boss..."
,"You're running a bit low on hearts."
,"They say that customers give you hearts when they're satisfied with your store."
,"We have to try to be the kind of store that will always satisfy its customers."
,"But in the meantime, I brought these from home. I hope you can use them."
"#01392","Boss..."
,"You're running low on coins..."
,"They're quite valuable and difficult to obtain."
,"So you'd better make sure you use them well!"
,"By the way, I got this in my change when I bought my snack today, so you can have it."
"#01393","You now have more staff. They've been assigned to Store #1."
,"You can check out your staff members by selecting<co=993300> <co=0066cc>""Staff"" > ""Staff List."""
,"Let's work with our new friends to boost the store's sales!"
"#01394","Boss! You did it!"
,"You got a manager-class staff member!"
,"That means you can <co=0066cc>start a second store</co> if you want!"
,"Why don't you open the map and see if you can find a good location for the second store?"
"#01395","Boss! You're getting a good selection of manager-class staff!"
,"Now you can <co=0066cc>open a third store</co>!"
,"Go ahead and choose the location you want!"
"#01396","Boss! You're getting a good selection of manager-class staff!"
,"You can manage a maximum of 3 stores at once."
,"If you want more than 3 stores, you'll need to make some of them into <co=0066cc>""auto-pilot stores""</co>."
,"You can have up to 10 ""auto-pilot stores""."
,"Select<co=0066cc> ""Store"" > ""Store Info,""</co> select the store you want release and then select ""<co=0066cc>Release</co>."""
"#01397","Hello."
,"I want to do my best as the new mayor of <town>."
,"Like the previous mayor, I welcome any ideas you might have to improve our town."
,"I hope to see you soon."
"#01398","By the way..."
,"We decided to put someone from the private sector in charge of<co=993300> <co=0066cc>introducing facilities </co>to <town>."
,"And <name> was unanimously chosen to be in charge of this initiative."
,"Select ""Store"" > ""Introduce"" to introduce new facilities to town."
,"Good luck!"
"#01399","Our store is getting an excellent reputation!"
,"Keep an eye on the Management Guide and try to become one of the most popular stores in town!"
"#01400","Boss! You've got quite a little nest egg saved up!"
,"If you have some extra manager-class employees, you could try setting up an ""<co=0066cc>auto-pilot store""</co>."
,"Also, if you start a new store in a well developed area, you may be able to manage a larger store!"
,"Try using the money you've got to make even more!"
"#01401","Boss! You've got quite a few hearts, I see!"
,"Hearts can be used to help your town develop."
,"You might try cooperating with the <co=0066cc>mayor's office</co>!"
,"Or you might try buying <co=0066cc>new things for your shops</co>!"
,"Use them well!"
"#01402","You've got quite a few coins saved up!"
,"It's probably not a bad idea to have some set aside for a rainy day!"
"#01403","Boss..."
,"You've got a number of <co=0066cc>management goods</co> in stock."
,"You might want to try using some of them. It can help you discover new uses for them!"
"#01404","Boss..."
,"You've got quite a bit of <co=0066cc>equipment </co>stored away, I see!"
,"If your staff have any free equipment slots, you should have them equip something!"
"#01405","Boss..."
,"I see you've got quite a few <co=0066cc>upgrade items </co>stashed away."
,"Why not try using them to upgrade your staff or research new products?"
"#01406","You've been losing money for some time now..."
,"If you have trouble getting your store out of the red..."
,"Try selecting <co=0066cc>""Staff"" > ""Staff List""</co> and assigning someone to the waiting room."
,"That can help reduce your upkeep costs."
,"You can also try rethinking your <co=0066cc>hours of operation </co>or the <co=0066cc>furnishings </co>you've placed."
"#01407","What's this...?"
,"It seems that a customer was so pleased with the service he received that he left us a <co=0066cc>present</co>!"
,"Any presents we get will be opened at the end of the month, so wait until the store closes."
,"I can't wait to see what's inside!"
"#01408","Our rival store is a formidable opponent!"
,"If you want to beat a rival store, <co=0066cc>improving sales</co> is the best strategy!"
,"Try upgrading your furnishings and products to expand your store!"
"#01409","Competing with your rival has reduced your store's vitality..."
,"If you want to refill your<co=993300> <co=0066cc>vitality</co>..."
,"It seems that assigning many staff to the store is important!"
,"Try reevaluating your staff list!"
"#01410","To power up, you need to select an item."
"#01411","Each year, contests are held between stores around the country. It's almost time for them to start!"
,"Of course, I took the liberty of entering <name>..."
,"I'll just go and check the mail..."
,"..."
"#01412","Wow!"
,"Our increase in reputation has triggered a lucky event!"
"#01413","So, we're finally open 24 hours a day!"
,"That should certainly help boost sales! But on the other hand..."
,"It can be a burden on the staff, and you won't be able to spend any time on research..."
,"You may want to select a different schedule from time to time."
