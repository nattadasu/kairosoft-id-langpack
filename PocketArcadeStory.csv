"#00349","An Arcade at Last"
"#00350","Locals had been clamoring for an arcade to be built, and at last their pleas have been answered.<br>Local residents, who up until now had been existing in a funless void yearning for distractions, immediately surged through the doors of this new establishment.<br>We found a local elementary school kid, who goes by the name of UltranightmareZ_xX, clawing at the doors of the arcade with a giant smile on his face. He said, ""The very second these doors open, I'm gonna run inside. Ohhh, what shall I play? WHAT SHALL I PLAY?!""<br>We here at Spawncamp Magazine wish <0> all the best, and will certainly be keeping a close eye on their progress from now on."

Oops, I've said too much!""<br>Could mixers really be the secret to victory?"

If you do, a themed area might appear!""<br>A top tip there for arcade managers; even if you can't install any new game machines, you can always try moving your existing ones to somewhere you think they might fit. Why not try it? You never know, something interesting might happen..."

After 3 hours of trying, we managed to get a statement from a crane game fanatic, JelloRAT-L33t3r. He said, ""I don't really have time to speak to you right now... What? No! It dropped it! Darn it, one more go!""<br>It appears despite picking a machine with a very high difficulty level, this fanatic is determined to win his prize. This arcade is certainly overflowing with smiles, and it seems very likely that it will soon become one of the most popular arcades around."
"#00369","5000 Fame Points"
"#00370","News just in! <0>'s Fame has reached 5000! Let the whole world join us in celebrating this happy and momentous occasion.<br>In fact, here is a message from one such well wisher... ""Howdy there partner! I am so clickerty clackery hip hop happy. I won't waste not one darned cotton picking second, I must go to the saloon at least once before I giddy up the ol' horses and hit the dusty trail.""<br>(Huh? This guy isn't talking about the arcade? But, I already did the interview...)<br>Well, hopefully <0> will continue to improve their services and install even more interesting games. We would love to see their fame increase even more!"
"#00371","10000 Fame Points"
"#00372","Our editors couldn't quite believe it, but it's true... <0>'s Fame has reached the dizzying heights of 10000!<br>The arcade's staff members also couldn't believe the news. We spotted one worker triple checking the numbers on an abacus and exclaiming... ""IT'S TRUE... IT'S ALL TRUE!!""<br>Over the years <0> has accomplished a magnificent transformation, turning from a small arcade into an indisputably splendid center for gaming. Surely, just like a familiar theme park, this arcade will continue to grow far into the future.<br>We have followed the journey of <0> from the very second its doors opened, right up until now. Everybody in the editorial team here at Spawncamp Magazine is welling up, and just has one thing to say: congratulations!"
"#00373","Themed Areas"
"#00374","ALERT! We have received word that a themed area has appeared in <0>.<br>Themed areas appear when compatible game machines are installed near each other. They have a handy effect whereby the appeal and cost to play of the machines in them increases.<br>We talked to 0x_princess-n0sc0pe_x0 (23) about this. With a smile 12 parsecs wide, she said, ""The atmosphere is so great here. I got all caught up in the games and spent way too much money... Now I'm going to have a live on mac 'n' cheese until my next paycheck...""<br>There are many varieties of themed areas out there, so it may be a good idea for all you arcade managers to try arranging your arcade machines in different ways."
"#00375","Rank Up!"
"#00376","Watch out, gamers, the freshly opened arcade, <0>, has already ranked-up!<br>We caught up with the arcade manager, who, with a fearless look in their eyes, danced nimbly while speaking to Spawncamp magazine. They said, ""You want to talk about ranking-up? Well, honestly, I just wanted to see the happy faces of our customers. If they aren't smiling, I feel agitated... That's what it was like when we first opened.""<br>Perhaps this arcade will become the eye of a storm... a storm called ""The Future of the Arcade Industry."" We will be sure to keep a weather eye on this one."
"#00377","3-Star Arcade"
"#00378","A report has just landed on our desk that <0>, known for its reliable management, has been awarded 3 stars!<br>We talked to the manager of another local arcade about this achievement. He said, ""Huh? Really? That was fast... But, it's nothing to do with us..."" Then, with the hint of a smile, he disguised himself using a nearby towel and set off gallantly on an undercover investigation.<br>It seems there's a disturbance in the force in the arcade industry... Influence is changing hands, and a bubbling undercurrent of change is gathering pace...<br><0> are gaining success after success, but how far will they really be able to go? Will they reach the very pinnacle of arcade management? We, for one, cannot wait to find out!"
"#00379","5-Star Arcade"
"#00380","Through steady yet bold management, the highly distinguished arcade, <0>, has been awarded 5-stars!<br>The manager was too emotional to comment, but a newly hired part-time worker, xXB00sT4ng3lXx (18), managed to talk to Spawncamp Magazine in a cool and collected manner. She said, ""For us, this award is but a simple checkpoint on the path to glory. We wish to be like the local amusement park, and keep on growing and growing.""<br>Perhaps we should all go for pizza in the mall tonight to celebrate!<br>Congratulations!"
"#00381","Crane Game-mania"
"#00382","Welcome gamers. Today we bring tidings of great joy. There are now 3 crane games installed in <0>!<br>A staff member who wished to remain anonymous expressed his relief at this achievement. He said, ""Back when we only had a small number of crane games, everybody used to frantically scramble to use them. But now, there are enough for everyone to have a go!""<br>It should be noted that if a customer wins a prize they have never won before, it is added to their ""prize list,"" and they gain bonus points.<br>Perhaps if you have lots of different prizes available, you can get your customers to be super happy."
"#00383","Wet Wipes"
"#00384","Attention gamers, we have some interesting news. Apparently <0> is now offering a free antibacterial wet wipe service! Naturally we headed straight to the arcade to find out more!<br>The dirty hands that come after playing arcade games are no more! This service has resolved the worries of all anxious, bacteria-fearing customers in a slightly moist and mint-scented flash. We spoke to one regular, and she said earnestly, ""It has solved the problem of sticky fingers in an instant, I'm really happy! Hmm, I wonder if I could take some home?""<br>It seems meticulous attention to the customers' needs is key to making an arcade better known in its community."
"#00385","An Oil Magnate"
"#00386","Big news, gamers. Spawncamp Magazine has intercepted a carrier pigeon and found information that a VIP has decided to visit <0>!<br>He's an oil tycoon, and a known gamer... And he was spotted playing games using the ample funds he obtained through his oil!<br>He seemed to be particularly fond of crane games, and everybody in the arcade had gathered around this VIP to watch him play! However we have recived a first hand report that he wasn't very good with the claw, and spent $500k trying to win a mug.<br>Well, if he spends that much money every time, I'm sure he will be well liked!"
"#00387","A Pizza Stand"
"#00388","It's here, straight from New York... <0> has installed a pizza stand!<br>While stuffing his face with piping hot pizza, one customer told us, ""I used to have to go back home when I was hungry, but now I can just grab a slice of pizza, fill my belly, and focus entirely on the games!""<br>It's likely that <0> will now attract even more customers with this cheesy installation. Perhaps they will introduce even more delicious food stands in the future!"
"#00389","Game Development"
"#00390","Spawncamp Magazine has the scoop of the century! <0> has begun work on developing a new game!<br>Their new game will be based on an existing game machine, but by adding various items, this newly developed game machine will be the only one of its kind in the world.<br>The performance of this new machine will depend on the compatibility of the items they use. Let's hope they develop a super-awesome original game machine that will become the pride of the arcade!"
"#00391","First Mixer"
"#00392","<0> have just held their first mixer.<br>Gamers of all ages came together to participate, and the happy voices of newly formed friendships could be heard all across the arcade.<br>The gamers exchanged information about play strategies, and when we poked our head in to see what was happening, we caught sight of players learning never-before-seen techniques!<br>We talked to one of the participants, oxoBread_pig4lyfoxo. She said, ""Now I've got more friends, I'm totally spending more and more time in the arcade!""<br>Perhaps with the success of this mixer, we will see yet another rise in sales."
"#00393","Token Games!"
"#00394","It has come to our understanding that <0> has finally installed a token game. Token games are especially popular with adults and seniors, so we rushed out to find a customer to ask about this news.<br>YeOldeSniper_4eva (79), tried to talk to us, but her grandson seemed to want to go and play games. She managed to calm him down, and said, ""Oh hello dearie, I'm just here to look after my grandson. But ooh, this is all rather interesting...""<br>If customers win too many tokens, the sales in the arcade won't increase, but if they win too few, the players won't be satisfied. Perhaps it would be wise for arcade managers to make a point of considering the difficulty level of their game machines."
"#00395","New Record!"
"#00396","The National Arcade Brigade has reported that <0> has attempted to beat a hi-score challenge and set a new record!<br>Hi-score challenges are separated by genre. To take on a challenge you need 3 customers who excel in the chosen genre. They take turns to play, and their individual scores are combined. As you can imagine, gaming skill is vital.<br>It might be a good idea for arcades wishing to try hi-score challenges to foster the skills of specialists in each genre at mixers."
"#00397","A Popular Arcade"
"#00398","Stay calm, gamers! We bring good news! Arcades are more popular than ever!<br>We sent our reporter to talk to a local arcade manager, xo_FuNkYlOoP_ox, to find out more. And, in a dignified narrative tone, he told us, ""The secret to our fame lies in the the fact that we have installed some original game machines. That's the main difference between us and other arcades.""<br>Perhaps other arcades that don't have many original games could try developing and installing some more? It would surely be worth the effort!"
"#00399","Development Points?"
"#00400","Hello, all you arcade managers out there. I think many of you will have accumulated quite a few development points by now. Am I right?<br>When developing a game machine in-house, it is more likely to become a popular game machine if you have a lot of development points. Why? Well the higher it is, the more items you will be able to add to the game.<br>By installing game machines that are appealing to customers, the whole arcade will become more famous! So, what are you waiting for? Let's do it!"
"#00401","Fun For All"
"#00402","Good news! It seems that <0> has taken n00bs into consideration and has installed some game machines that even a new gamer can clear.<br>We managed to talk to M0nstarKilla123 (8), who has managed to clear his first ever game today! He left us with this happy comment, ""I've never ever cleared a game, even though I always spend all my pocket money trying! But I managed to clear this game in just one try! Now I'm going to play 9 more times!""<br>Good luck, kid. Good luck."
"#00403","Mega Difficult?"
"#00404","We here at Spawncamp Magazine have heard a rumor that <0> has set one of their game machines to ""mega difficult.""<br>We went to investigate this rumor and found the arcade brimming with life, as a real hoard of self-confident tough guys crowded around the machine.<br>So gamers, come and have go if you think you're tough enough! (But be careful, don't hurt your fingers by playing too much!)"

"#00567","Well done.<br><0> years have now passed,<br>this part of the game is over."
,"Now it's time to work out your total Clear Points."
"#00568","You have a total of <co=0066cc><0></co> Clear Points."
,"Congratulations!<br>You set a new high score!"
,"Maybe you'll get an even better score the next time you play!"
"#00569","You have a total of <co=0066cc><0></co> Clear Points."
,"Aw, you didn't beat your high score."
,"You'll just have to try again next time!"
"#00570","Your high score won't be updated after this,"
,"but feel free to keep playing as long as you like!"
,"We hope you'll enjoy the game for a long time to come."
"#00571","Nice to meet you!"
,"I'll be your assistant. I look forward to working with you!"
,"Here we are in this newly opened arcade. At the moment there aren't many games, but I'm sure it'll be bustling before long!"
,"OK, so let's get going!<br>First select <co=0066cc>Build</co> from the Menu."
"#00572","Welcome!"
"#00573","Thank you for coming!"
"#00574","Not enough gold..."
"#00575","Not enough satisfaction points..."
"#00576","Not enough development points..."
"#00577","I'm sorry, we've sold out for today."
"#00578","You don't seem to have any grabbable items."
"#00579","You don't seem to have any items."
"#00580","You don't have any edible items."
"#00581","You don't have any installations at the moment."
"#00582","There don't seem to be any other customers you can invite."
"#00583","You can't hire any more staff members."
,"If you want to hire a new staff member, you'll have to fire someone first..."
,"As the rank of your arcade increases, you will be able to hire more staff."
"#00584","Let's set an item!"
"#00585","You can't set any more items."
,"Earn more development points and you will be able to use more items."
"#00586","There are no campaigns you can implement right now..."
"#00587","<0> is not in the arcade right now."
"#00588","You can't develop any more games."
,"You can develop a new game if you recycle an existing one."
"#00589","You lost... A good gaming skill is key to winning in tournaments."
,"Customers can get accustomed to different games at mixers."
,"If you increase their gaming skill, I'm sure they will perform well in tournaments."
"#00590","Aw, it was a good bout... Let's improve our customers' gaming skill and try again!"
"#00591","Spectacular! You've won the tournament! Congratulations!"
"#00592","It seems that our customer, <co=0066cc><0>,</co> has leveled up while playing a game."
,"When customers play games they gain experience points, increasing their gaming skill."
,"The amount of money they spend per play will also increase. Let's create a lovely arcade and help our customers grow!"
"#00593","Here you can see the details of the game machines in your arcade."
"#00594","This is where you can use the arcade's game machines to hold mixers."
,"If a customer improves their gaming skill, they might become a regular visitor."
"#00595","Choose the game that you want to use at the mixer."
"#00596","Introducing a variety of campaigns will help make your arcade more famous."
,"However, they do cost gold, so be sure to check your funds and pick the right campaigns for your budget."
"#00597","This is where you can find the national arcade hi-score challenge."
,"If you have confidence in your customers, please give it a try!"
"#00598","Greetings! I'm Pumpkin Products, the gaming world's traveling jack-o'-lantern of all trades!"
,"I've heard a rumor that your arcade is getting quite a reputation."
,"I sell many things, perhaps you could use them as prizes in your crane games."
,"Why don't you browse my wares right away?"
"#00599","Select <co=0066cc>Shop</co> from the game menu to visit pumpkin products at any time."
,"Thank you, come again!"
"#00600","Select the game you want to use in the mixer and the customers you wish to invite!"
"#00601","<0> and <1> have become friends!"
,"It seems customers with a lot of friends will play more games."
,"Let's make sure our customers make as many friends as possible."
"#00602","You've matched specific combinations of game machines together, and a <co=0066cc>themed area</co> has appeared!"
,"Games in a themed area will be more appealing, and cost more to play."
,"Check <co=0066cc>Themed Areas</co> in the Info menu, and aim to complete them all!"
"#00603","This is where you can change the settings of your game machines."
,"Making your games easier will make customers happy, and they'll gain more satisfaction points."
,"But, if you make them harder, your customers' gaming skill will greatly increase!"
,"Adjust your machines to create an arcade that everybody can enjoy!"
"#00604","Greetings gamers! We are the National Arcade Brigade (NAB)!"
,"We heard it on the grapevine that <0> has recently opened."
,"We conduct nationwide arcade rankings and calculate game high scores."
,"Until next time, keep gaming!"
"#00605","Hi. I used to go to another arcade, but there's no one there who can challenge me."
,"I think I'm ready to compete in a tournament. I hope someone from <0> is on my level."
,"I'm looking forward to the day we meet in battle! Bye for now!"
"#00606","A tournament? What a great idea! That will be sure to bring in the customers."
,"Check out the <co=0066cc>Fight</co> menu and invite a customer to the tournament."
"#00607","I was at a management seminar, and it seems other arcades use seasonal events to attract customers."
,"Perhaps we should try this tactic too, and host a seasonal event around our games!"
"#00608","It's spring break!"
,"Let's get everyone pumped with an event!"
"#00609","It's summer vacation!"
,"Let's get everyone pumped with an event!"
"#00610","It's the holidays!"
,"Let's get everyone pumped with an event!"
"#00611","Boss!"
,"Thanks to your arcade becoming more famous, lots of new people have been coming to visit!"
"#00612","A new customer has come to the arcade!"
"#00613","There's a new customer in the arcade!"
"#00614","You've done well... But, can you defeat me?"
,"Today I will show you my power forged in the light of countless LCD screens!"
"#00615","Noooooo, you beat me!"
"#00616","I thought you'd be better than that... How disappointing."
,"One day you will be ready. I shall have to wait with anticipation until then."
"#00617","You're pretty good... But that was just my henchman. I won't go down so easy!"
,"I'll show you the power of the arcade's perfect attendance award prizewinner!"
"#00618","Aaargh! I suppose I must admit defeat gracefully. Such is a gentleman's duty."
"#00619","Unlimited poooooower! Can you feel it?!"
,"Come back any time you need a workout! Hahaha!"
"#00620","Not bad for an old timer."
,"But I'm your next opponent! Let's roll!"
"#00621","Whoa, you're really strong. But, I thought I was the best fighter in the arcade..."
,"I'm going to go to another arcade to practice..."
"#00622","Humph, defeat is inevitable when faced with my true power!"
,"You can fight me as many times as you want, but I will always win..."
"#00623","Don't let my bodybuilder phisique fool you, the only 6 pack I have is soda."
,"I'll show you my superior stickmanship!"
"#00624","Good game..."
"#00625","Hmmm? My stickhandling skills?"
,"You want to see them again? Hah, I will always win, you know!"
"#00626","Huh? You beat the other guy? Not bad... But you're playing with the big boys now!"
,"I will not lose! Why? I'm a superhero, that's why!"
"#00627","But, how…? I'm a superhero... How could I lose…?"
,"This arcade's players are too strong for me, I'm think I'm going to go elsewhere!"
"#00628","The glorious final blow is mine by right. It is with sweet justice that I claim this win."
,"Let us meet on the battlefield once more!"
"#00629","I come to the arcade every day after work. I'm a real game lover for sure."
,"Enjoy the experience of losing to my supreme techniques!"
"#00630","How... My one true love has betrayed me... I need to find a new hobby..."
,"Or maybe just a new arcade..."
"#00631","Ohohohohohoh! You think you can beat me? Come back in about 12 years!!"
,"But feel free to try any time!"
"#00632","Right, let me show you the power of a real pro! Bring it!"
"#00633","Oh no... I was using my left hand... Whoops... Heh..."
,"(<0>...? Well, I guess I'll hang around and just see how this goes...)"
"#00634","This sort of thing is commonplace when you become a pro."
,"I will face you again any time."
"#00635","You have potential, but it will be some time yet before you can beat me."
,"Feast your eyes upon my magnificent deathblow!"
"#00636","Ahhh, you're too strong! I'm all clammy and sweaty!"
,"You guys at <0> are really strong... I'm going to come here from now on!"
"#00637","I told you couldn't beat me."
,"Come back any time, I'll show you my brilliance as many times as you like!"
"#00638","I watched your previous battles... That's quite some skill you have..."
,"Let me show you my unbeatable technique!"
"#00639","Wh-whaaat?! H-how could I lose... Maybe I need to practice a little more..."
,"I'm going to go find an arcade where I can hone my skills. Have a nice day!"
"#00640","I have wandered the world and yet still I feel unsatisfied..."
,"I wait in anticipation for a challenge worthy of my skill."
"#00641","Heh heh, I thought you'd do well. But now I'm your opponent, things will change!"
,"Shall we dance?"
"#00642","Could it be... I... lost?"
,"How dreadfully awesome! I need to check out the other arcades around here..."
"#00643","I had a feeling you were good... It seems my fear was not misplaced this time."
,"I'm never gonna be good enough for the gaming special show at this rate!"
"#00644","You're better than I thought... But, you're still no match for me!"
,"Now, let's try that again! I'll show you how much skill you lack!"
"#00645","Urgh! You have amazing technique... You completely blindsided me!"
,"I look forward to the day when I can face you again. But until then, goodbye."
"#00646","Heh heh, you are not worthy. Beating you will be a piece of cake."
,"I'll accept your challenge any time, any place!"
"#00647","You've been winning up until now, but there's always a bigger fish, now quit monkeying around!"
,"I'm the king of the hill! And even if there's just one banana tree up there, I'm a happy chimp."
,"So bring it! Let's see who's the king of the swingers."
"#00648","OK, OK! You got me! I never thought that this day would come..."
,"I ripped the back of my pants yesterday... So that might be why I lost..."
,"I'm going to focus entirely on my banana plantation business from now on. Bye!"
"#00649","You're as soft as an overripe banana... You gotta toughen up some more."
,"One day you will be ready. I shall have to wait with anticipation until then."
"#00650","Hehehe, you've been doing well, haven't you? But I wonder, can you beat me?"
,"Today I will show you my power forged in the light of countless LCD screens!"
"#00651","Humph, well done."
"#00652","Phew, you really have practiced hard. But know this... I was playing using my feet!"
,"I look forward to the day when I can face you again."
"#00653","Hehehe, I am the mysterious robot! If you beat me, maybe I'll tell you who I am... Huh, you already know?"
,"Enough small talk! Let me show you the skills that I been honing for this very day!"
"#00654","Unfortunately, I've been fired from my job as a mascot..."
,"I ran out of options, so now I'm collecting antiques to make a living..."
,"But I'm visiting arcades whenever I can to hone my skills!"
"#00655","I guess this kind of thing can be expected if you only have my level of 8-bit artificial intelligence."
,"My battery is going to run out soon but... L...ets ... Batt...le... a..gain..."
"#00656","Teehee, let's do this! I am the beautiful and mysterious robot, Sally Prin. I like knitting and watching sports."
,"I wore specially tailored clothes for this battle! Look!"
"#00657","I haven't eaten very much today, perhaps that's why I'm lacking in power..."
,"I'm going to go and eat a donut while contemplating why I lost."
"#00658","You're going to need to be tougher to beat me. You're like ice cream, all soft and wet... How unfortunate."
,"But, I'm always willing to accept you challenge. I'm looking forward to my battle souvenir... A sundae!"
"#00659","Wanna get to the next round? You're gonna have to get through me first!"
,"I might be a kid but don't mess with me, or I'll give you something to cry about!"
"#00660","Feh, I lost... I was going easy on you, you know?"
"#00661","What the heck?! I thought this would be a cinch!"
,"I'm going to practice some more and get stronger, then you can face me again."
"#00662","Oh, so you wanna win the tournament? Then you gotta beat me. I wont go easy!"
,"I'll give you a taste of my sick combos! Prepare to fight!"
"#00663","Noooooo, I... I... lost! OK, from today I'm implementing a rigorous training program."
"#00664","Huh? How can this be? I always win..."
,"I'm going to go and wash the stains of defeat from my face and start anew."
"#00665","Heh heh, you've been doing well. But you're out of your depth here!"
,"If you want in, you'll have to get through me first!"
"#00666","What? How did you beat me? I thought this was going to be easy... What profound sadness..."
"#00667","Hmm, you're getting better... One baby step at a time."
,"One day you will be ready. I shall have to wait with anticipation until then."
"#00668","I knew you would make it this far. But you'll have to beat me if you want to progress!"
,"I have been devising my strategy over many years, let me show you my moves!"
"#00669","Gee, you're really strong! I wonder if you can make it all the way to the top? I'm rooting for you!"
"#00670","My, my, how green. I was hoping you'd be a bit more of a challenge. How disappointing."
,"One day you will be ready. I shall have to wait with anticipation until then."
"#00671","I have been waiting. I see you have been gaining power, let's test your might."
,"Let us begin. I will show you the true meaning of power."
"#00672","I think there must have been some oil on the floor, and I slipped... That's why I lost."
,"I should work on mining natural gas, in addition to oil, back in my home country."
"#00673","If you can't beat me, you can't progress to the next rank of the tournament!"
,"Sooo, you might want to train some more first, yeah?"
"#00674","Congratulations. You've reached the final barrier... ME!"
,"You are about to face power like you have never known. You will fall beneath my fist! Let's rumble!"
"#00675","I am defeated. Now, rise and progress to the final stage. Be prepared, they won't be as merciful as I am."
"#00676","You have done well, small fry. But, you are not yet ready to progress to the final stage."
,"You dare to challenge me? I will crush you, any time! Except for Sunday mornings…"
"#00677","Hello. There seems to be no shortage of terrible opponents these days. Let's fight!"
"#00678","Humph, you did well."
"#00679","Oh, I won again... Sometimes I envy those who know the bitter taste of defeat."
"#00680","EAT MY 15-HIT COMBO!"
"#00681","Can it be? There's somebody who can withstand my flurry of fists? I've failed..."
"#00682","My combos are not enough?"
"#00683","Bring it!"
"#00684","Too bad!"
"#00685","Oh? Alas, the king has fallen... I felt so strong before, I wonder if perhaps I got too strong?"
"#00686","<co=0066cc><0></co> can only participate once a month."
,"Please wait until next month before participating again."
"#00687","Greetings. I am the Vice President of the National Arcade Brigade. We oversee arcades nationwide."

"#00761","Thanks for a great battle!"
"#00762","You seem to have a lot of development points, let's remove some items."
"#00763","Let's choose some development items!"
"#00764","It seems you can't add any more development items to that game."
,"If you accumulate development points in a specific genre, the capacity of the games you can develop will increase too!"
"#00765","You don't have enough <co=0066cc>development points</co>, you can't add any more items."
"#00766","Hello!<br>I've heard a rumor that a lot of great gamers come to this arcade!"
,"I hope you're participating in the next tournament, I've been looking for a good challenge."
,"Let's meet on the battlefield!"
"#00767","Hi! I'm a customer from a nearby arcade. I was a spectator at the last tournament."
,"I think I'm on your level, so if it's OK with you I'd like to participate in the next tournament."
"#00768","Greetings! I heard a tasty rumor about <0>, and just had to see for myself if it was true."
,"I want to beat <0>, and make a name for my own arcade!"
,"Isn't that cool?"
"#00769","Y-yes, boss. Yes, I've managed to infiltrate <0>..."
,"Ah! They've spotted me! I'm sorry..."
,"The long-awaited battle... So, shall we dance?"
"#00770","Good day. I've heard that gamers coming to <0> are improving at an extraordinary rate."
,"You should try the Rank Matchups to show people how strong you are. I'd love to see that!"
"#00771","Why hello!<br>I'm an oil magnate from the middle east who loves playing games every day!"
,"I normally like to play cards at the casino, but now I want to try playing some games in a cool arcade!"
,"Please come to the next tournament! Don't worry, you can use my private jet."
"#00772","Ooh-ooh ah-ah! I'm an ape with an IQ of 200!"
,"I was on my favorite website when I saw news of this tournament, and I knew I had to come."
,"So, I'll see you at the next tournament!"
"#00773","Bzzzt... Hello.<br>I. Am. A. Jolly. 8-bit. Robot."
,"I have decided to test my own parameters through the medium of video games."
,"Bzzzt..."
"#00774","How do you do?"
,"I was channel-hopping, and happened to catch the coverage on your latest tournament."
,"I have a taste for games and have played them for over 900 hours! So, if it's OK, shall we battle? Ohohohoho!"
"#00775","My sister told me about this place, so I started coming here. And, before I knew it, I became super strong!"
,"Thanks a lot!"
"#00776","Hello. I wish to show you my combos in an epic battle of strength and skill! Shall we?"
"#00777","Long time no see. After seeing your last tournament I installed a game machine in my own home and trained hard."
,"Now I'm even better than before! You think you can defeat me? Well, you can try... Ohohohohooo!"
"#00778","Boss... We've counted, re-counted, and counted again. There's no mistake, our funds are in minus figures!"
,"I had to break into my little brothers piggy bank... There was <0> in there, here have it."
,"Keep working hard and lead this arcade to greatness!"
"#00779","Boss!"
,"If you demolish an original game machine, you won't ever be able to install it again!"
,"If you don't like where a machine is placed, use the move tool!"
"#00780","I see you've managed to build an arcade here. Well, good luck for the future!"
"#00781","Hey! You know, studying is way too easy, this year I got 100% in every exam I've taken so far!"
,"I have a while to wait before my next exam, so I thought I'd spend some time playing in the arcade."
"#00782","Hello. I used to use my abacus as a skateboard, but after 5 years of it it's getting stale."
,"So I thought I'd come to this arcade and look for new ways to have fun!"
"#00783","G-good day! I'm in a famous chess club at my school. But due to declining birth rates, I'm the only member."
,"I think I'll make some great memories having fun with<br>battling at this arcade."
"#00784","Thanks for the other day. There's a girl I like in my class. I'd love to say something to her, but I get so embarrassed."
,"But if I get a job here, maybe someday I can grasp her heart with one of the crane game claws."
"#00785","Hi! I bet my friend a whole stack of pancakes that I'd win a tournament."
,"With that much syrup-y goodness on the line, I need to invest all my lunch money in training!"
"#00786","Hey hey! I study electrical engineering at college. I've decided I want to start up an indie game development company."
,"It's gonna be really epic... But first I will check out how enjoyable the games are, with my soldering iron in hand!"
"#00787","Yo, thanks for the other day. As part of my core business, I try to give a free plushy to every customer who buys something."
,"I have a hunch that, if I have the right skills, this venture would be cheaper if I earned the funds through gaming..."
"#00788","Hey, thanks for the other day. My dreams are finally coming true! The milkshake parlor where I've been working for years has finally made me manager!"
,"I'm thrilled! I'm gonna play some games, and ride the musical waves! Bop beeperty boo!"
"#00789","Greetings. While kneading bread I became aware that perhaps I could try using my hands for other things."
,"I'm still only a beginner, but I'm determined to become a master gamer! I'm going to knead my way to greatness!"
"#00790","Why helloooooo!<br>Thanks to you I successfully disbanded the enemy army and drove them away!"
,"My TV show has also ended... Now I will fight to protect the peace of this arcade instead! HYAAAR!"
"#00791","Great to meet you!<br>My start-up company has succeeded and I've come into a lot of money!"
,"Now, I'm starting to <br>consider entering the social<br>games market, so I've come<br>to your arcade to investigate."
"#00792","Hi! When I became an office worker all I wanted to do is go back to being young again. Unfortunately, that's impossible."
,"So now I want to do what's close to my heart, play games like a kid!"
"#00793","Thanks for the other day. People say that I'm the serious one in my comedy duo. Huh? You haven't heard of us?"
,"My partner is at work, so I decided to come and play here to use for some new material."
"#00794","Bonjour! You really helped out the other day. This arcade is as rich and flavorful as a good cheese."
,"In fact, I have a cheese fair to attend in France, but I think I'll kill some time here before I go."
"#00795","Hello.<br>I discovered this arcade while supervising the nearby construction site."
,"I've left my son in charge of the site so I could come here to play! If I win something I'll give it to him as a present."
"#00796","Well hello. I recently spotted my grandkid, who only ever used to play with an abacus, in here having fun."
,"I thought we could play together, so I've come here to practice."
"#00797","Good day. When surrounded by my favourite imported sundries, I can pass by many a day in happiness, but…"
,"… I have to entertain a dear CEO with videogames during his visit, so I'm here to gather information."
"#00798","Hey, thanks for the other day. I was once a famous person who swayed the hearts of a generation. These days, not so much..."
,"But when I lost in the tournament, my inner gaming demon awoke! Maybe I shouldn't get too serious..."
"#00799","'Sup.<br>The other day I met a nice young lady in a costume at my tea shop."
,"She said it was a character from this arcade, so I thought I'd look around and see if I can find out who she was dressed as."
"#00800","Yo, thanks for the other day.<br>I am a mysterious robot hoping to find products of me."
,"I heard maybe someone here might be selling them. I really can't rest until I find them."
,"Well, if they do come on sale, make sure you buy them."
"#00801","Hello! Thanks for the other day! I can speak 108 languages you know, that's why they call me a chimpan-genius."
,"I was busy managing my banana plantation when this arcade appeared. I thought I'd come and have a look around."
"#00802","Hey hey, thanks for the other day.<br>I am a king, rich from the plentiful oilfields of the middle east."
,"I heard there's lots of fun games to play here. I think I'll use my private jet to come and visit whenever I feel like it."
"#00803","Greetings fellow human.<br>I heard that <co=0066cc><1></co> is now at <0>, so I came to play."
,"Ah, I see <1> over there! I'm so excited to see it! I think I'll come here more often."
"#00804","Well hello there! I'm here to meet my sweetheart for a date. We went to the same kindergarten, you know."
,"I wonder what games we can play together? Heeheehee, what fun!"
"#00805","Helloooooo! I heard a rumor that my sweetheart has been hanging around here playing games with other girls!"
,"I want to show him that it's more fun to play games with me, so I need to practice super hard!"
"#00806","Howdy!<br>Is this the arcade where all our students keep going?"
,"I must find the game that's got them hooked and play it! For science, of course."
"#00807","Hey! There's this gang leader in my class who's always staring at me... It's really scary."
,"I'm going to hide here for now, and indulge in my guilty pleasure: gaming. Youth isn't wasted on this young one."
"#00808","Hi!<br>I've decided I want to dress up as one of the characters from this arcade's games."
,"I'm gonna deicide which cute character to be by playing the games."
"#00809","What's up! I took some photos here yesterday, and I was surprised to find they were even cuter than I imagined."
,"I'd love to take some more cute photos! Please let meeeeee!"
"#00810","Salutations!<br>This place is really lively and fun filled..."
,"Next month I'm going to hold a one-man exhibition based on myself. Nobody will be able to resist attending!"
"#00811","G'day!<br>I like to bowl, but recently the arthritis in my fingers has been flaring up."
,"I thought, if I come to the arcade and work them out, I might get better. Hyaaa! Let's move! Ouch, maybe not..."
"#00812","Hi, thanks for the other day! All I do all day every day is fetch tea and coffee... There's no sign at all of me becoming CEO."
,"Maybe if I get better at games, I'll be able to get ahead. I think I'm gonna get revved up and become stronger, starting today."
"#00813","A very good day to you! Recently my husband successfully changed jobs, so now I have too much <br>free time on my hands."
,"I got tired of housework, so I want to play games instead. It also serves as a light exercise, you know."
"#00814","Hello.<br>The other day my son spent all his lunch money on gaming."
,"I made his favorite hamburger for dinner but he didn't come home. I've come to see what's keeping him away from my cooking."
"#00815","Hiya! I'm came here before to gather data for my report on the recent happenings at <0>..."
,"...But now I'm here to play! Y'know, if you read Spawncamp Magazine, I'm sure you'll spot a good story."
"#00816","Yo yo yo yo yo! I'm the owner of the local donut store. Soon there will be tournament held around here, but..."
,"...Seeing as I'm free until then, I think I'll spend some time having fun and playing games! Wahoo!"
"#00817","Greetings! I've lived an artistic life to the grand old age of 85, but I can't help but feel like the canvas is getting bigger..."
,"I can feel the rejuvenating vigor of youth in this arcade. I'm going to double my efforts and create a new masterpiece!"
"#00818","How do you do? I might be old and demure now, but let me tell you, when I was younger, I was a judo champion!"
,"I still have that fighting spirit, but because my body is not what it used to be, I thought I'd try gaming instead!"
"#00819","Ni hao!<br>I work in a local chinese restaurant that has existed for over 4000 years."
,"My manager said that if I beat them in their favorite game I can get a pay rise, so I'm here today for a crash course."
"#00820","Heh heh heh... You really helped me out the other day... You know, I'm a mysterious globe-trotting spy."
,"Since I never know when I'm going to become a target, I think I'm just going to hide here and play games. Heh heh heh..."
"#00821","Ah! Thanks for the other day! Seeing as I only work on Sundays, I think I'll spend the rest of the week here in this arcade."
,"I think all the children might gather around me, but please be patient, kids, one at a time..."
"#00822","Many thanks for the other day. I saw this arcade from the venue of the donut contest, so I gave up half way and ran over here."
,"There're so many fun looking games here. I need to play them all! Oh, can you put my trophy somewhere around here?"
"#00823","The prize in <0> is now <co=0066cc><1></co>."
"#00824","The <1> for <0> has been set to <co=0066cc><2></co>."
"#00825","This is where you can change which prizes are available in <0>."
,"As customers win prizes the number available in the machine decreases. Make sure it doesn't run out!"
,"If you turn auto-fill on by tapping the left button, the machine will re-fill its stock when it runs low."
"#00826","It seems like <0> has no prizes left. Let's change the prize available by using the machine's Prizes menu."
,"If you turn auto-fill on by tapping the left button, the machine will re-fill its stock when it runs low."
"#00827","<0> is ready to go!"
,"You can change the prize available in <0>. Make sure lots of cool prizes are available in <0>, and our arcade will become even more famous!"
"#00828","Thank you so much!<br>I'm going to have so much fun!"
"#00829","Thank you for inviting me! I'm here to play games and make friends!"
"#00830","Really? You mean it?!<br>It's really nice to be praised by others when you get more skilled at games."
"#00831","Let's install a new game machine right away!"
,"We've received a shipment of new game machines. Pick which one you want to install from the <co=0066cc>Games</co> menu."
"#00832","As your arcade becomes more famous, maybe new customers will come to visit."
,"There are various campaigns you can implement, but keep an eye on your funds!"
"#00833","Let's try and develop a really popular game machine!"
"#00834","Hello hello hello. I represent Kumax Construction. We specialize in designing amusement parks and arcades."
,"How about expanding the arcade so that we can try and fit more things in here?"
"#00835","Congratulations!<br>You can finally <co=0066cc>expand your arcade</co>."
,"You should definitely expand your arcade to pull in lots of customers. You can do this from the Campaigns menu."
"#00836","Hello!"
,"I found this during an event. I'd be delighted if you'd take it."
"#00837","Hello!"
,"I want to play a token game, but there isn't a Token Machine anywhere…"
"#00838","Oh, it seems customers cannot play the token game you just installed."
,"Let's install a Token Machine quickly."
"#00839","Choose over 2 participants!"
"#00840","When you adjusted that game machine, you found some development points!"
"#00841","There aren't any game machines you can use this on."
"#00842","Lets change a machine's settings."
"#00843","The <co=0066cc><0></co> genre is already max level."
"#00844","Set the difficulty of all the game machines in your arcade to <co=0066cc><0></co>."
"#00845","Right! Finally the battle has begun!"
,"Your character will fight on its own, but you can give them a helping hand using the 3 buttons below."
,"<co=808000>Yellow button</co> for combo attacks,<br><co=ff0000>Red button</co> for high damage attacks,<br><co=008000>Green button</co> to guard."
,"Give your opponent no mercy, and aim for that knockout!"
"#00846","Fists will soon fly, and you must be prepared!"
,"The 3 buttons are vital to your victory. Press them too often, however, and your character will become unable to move."
,"So be sure to only push them when you know it will be of use."
"#00847","There's somebody in your arcade in aura mode!"
"#00848","A customer in aura mode will exhibit aura powers and play many more games than usual."
,"Installing facilities other than game machines seems to be a good way to help people enter aura mode."
"#00849","<0> is a tournament limited to <co=0066cc><1></co>."
"#00850","You can't fire <co=0066cc><0></co>."
"#00851","If you install lots of game machines and hold mixers, you'll definitely get good scores in hi-score challenges."
,"So prepare yourself, and take on some hi-score challenges!"
"#00852","It's time to carry out a <co=0066cc>location test</co>."
,"Please install the game you developed somewhere in your arcade."
"#00853","Use the <co=0066cc>Game Development</co> tab under Activities in the menu to hold the location test later. Don't forget!"
"#00854","The test game machine has been installed."
,"I look forward to seeing the customers' feedback!"
"#00855","Location test complete!"
,"A total of<co=0066cc> <0></co> customers have given us their feedback. Let's check it out!"
"#00856","You cannot develop new games while a location test is underway."
"#00857","Phew! The location test is complete and the machine has been removed. You can install it properly from the Build menu."
"#00858","You can only install one original game."
"#00859","Original game machine limit reached, you cannot develop any more."
,"If you recycle some of your existing games, you'll be able to develop some more."
"#00860","Hey, I know, why not try inviting a new customer?"
"#00861","Oh, it looks like this tournament is limited to <co=0066cc><0></co>."
,"Each tournament has its own entry requirements. Make sure we enter the right people for the tournaments!"
"#00862","This tournament is limited to <co=0066cc><0></co>."
"#00863","You don't have anybody who can participate in this tournament."
"#00864","Let's install it in the arcade right away!"
"#00865","Hello!"
,"<0> has a good energy. Please continue doing your best!"
"#00866","We also have this prize for the crane game today."
"#00867","You can't buy any more..."
"#00868","You have filled all the available installation spaces..."
,"I hear that if you Rank Up and receive a star from the National Arcade Brigade, it might be possible to expand the arcade."
,"So, let's really try and Rank Up!"
"#00869","I strained my fingers playing last time, so I need to soothe them in chamomile and rest a little."
"#00870","Soon it will be a super sale day! Make sure you're here bright and early for the bargains!"
"#00871","I only really want to play shooting games right now, so I think I'll pass."
"#00872","I got tired out helping tourists around the arcade the other day... So I'm staying at home today."
"#00873","I'm walking my dog, and he's told me that he doesn't want to go to the venue..."
"#00874","<0> has just participated in a tournament, I think they deserve a rest. Let's choose somebody else."
"#00875","You can only run 3 campaigns at the same time. Please wait a little while until one has finished."
"#00876","You cannot demolish a game while it is in the middle of a location test. Please wait until it has finished."
"#00877","You cannot move a game while it is in the middle of a location test. Please wait a little until it has finished."
"#00878","You expanded your arcade! Here, take this as a celebratory present!"
"#00879","Adding themed areas will help you expand even more. Do this by using the <co=0066cc>move </co>tool to try and organize your games."
"#00880","It seems like you have met the requirements necessary to<co=0066cc> Rank Up your arcade</co>!"
,"Choose <co=0066cc>Rank Up Arcade</co> from the menu and rank up!"
"#00881","Welcome!<br>How does a <co=0066cc><0></co> <br>sound?"
"#00882","Welcome!<br>We have new products in stock today!"
"#00883","Welcome!<br>We have new products in stock today!"
,"Why not try buying some game development items."
"#00884","You can change the clothes your staff members are wearing by tapping them while they are selected."
,"So, let's get them to wear your favorite color!"
"#00885","If you recycle a game, you'll get your development points back, but the game itself will be destroyed."
"#00886","Do you want to recycle <co=0066cc><0></co>?"
"#00887","You can recycle original games by pressing the <co=0066cc>Recycle</co> button. If you do this, you will obtain development points."
,"Try recycling some of those older original games."
