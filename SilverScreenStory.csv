"#01937","It was the first time I actually fell asleep watching a movie."
"#01938","Not bad. But not good either."
"#01939","Couldn't see the screen for all my tears. My eyes water whenever I yawn."
"#01940","Nothing to tickle the fancy of a movie enthusiast."
"#01941","Nothing to write back home about."
"#01942","The plot made absolutely no sense."
"#01943","The cast needs to go back to acting school."
"#01944","The worldbuilding was lacking."
"#01945","Two hours of absolute boredom."
"#01946","Well-made, but not especially exciting."
"#01947","Couldn't distract me from my phone."
"#01948","The protagonist's performance goes downhill from the second half on."
"#01949","The lead's performance raised many questions. Such us, what on earth were they doing?"
"#01950","The supporting actor's performance was the only saving grace."
"#01951","There were so many scenes I was surprised had not been edited out."
"#01952","I just wanted it to end."
"#01953","The protagonist looked nothing like themself in the flashbacks to the past."
"#01954","So many loose threads in the plot."
"#01955","It was promising. Looking forward to the studio's next production."
"#01956","It was an extra long movie, but well-worth watching."
"#01957","Apart from the ending, it was very good."
"#01958","The studio should have it shown at more movie theaters."
"#01959","It was fairly average."
"#01960","A bit disappointing how predictable the plot was."
"#01961","The dialog was so strange I was wondering if they were still speaking English."
"#01962","A good start for this movie studio."
"#01963","Not bad. Hopefully their next movie will be even better."
"#01964","It was a decent movie. Got my hopes up for the next."
"#01965","It was fairly ordinary, but no complaints."
"#01966","One step away from deserving to be called excellent."
"#01967","You could tell that the director had vision and knew very well what they were doing."
"#01968","If it only were a bit more balanced."
"#01969","Tiresome. No originality."
"#01970","The actors conveyed a variety of emotions with subtlety."
"#01971","A good movie that's sure to sell lots of tickets."
"#01972","Couldn't stop thinking about it for a long time after the end."
"#01973","Excellent acting paired with stunning imagery!"
"#01974","The reveal with the protagonist's father took me by surprise."
"#01975","It's a wonderful movie that you just don't want to end."
"#01976","Every aspect of this movie is polished and well-executed. I dare other reviewers to find something to criticize."
"#01977","Breathtaking scenes and solid storyline."
"#01978","A new spin on common tropes -- brilliant job."
"#01979","The protagonist gets eaten at the beginning?!"
"#01980","The audience is going to be blown away by the plot twist at the end."
"#01981","It's a common story, but very well told."
"#01982","It's a masterpiece, perfect in every aspect."
"#01983","A masterpiece. You'll wish it'll never end."
"#01984","I heartily recommend it to everyone."
"#01985","I'd happily watch it again with my family."
"#01986","It's a movie not to miss."
"#01987","The studio behind it is on the right track."
"#01988","There are so many remarkable elements, together making it a masterful production."
"#01989","Definitely the best movie of the year."
"#01990","Guaranteed to move the audience to tears."
"#01991","A true masterpiece I watched 5 times already. Need to watch it again..."
"#01992","Superb. Pure perfection."
"#01993","I never shed this many tears watching a movie before."
"#01994","This movie is a triumph and will certainly be remembered as one of the best productions in the history of cinema."
"#01995","The director's genius clearly shows in this movie. I have nothing but praise for it."
"#01996","In my humble opinion, this was the best movie of this century."
"#01997","An engrossing movie certain to become a worldwide hit."
"#01998","I've never seen anything like it. Top marks!"

"#02306","So let's get started with our first production... Oops, we don't even have a movie studio yet!"
"#02307","No worries, I've got your back! You can have this studio for free, to set you on the right track."
"#02308","Oh wow, we got a wonderful movie studio!"
"#02309","Let's place it on the empty area to the right."
"#02310","Howdy. Please entrust any construction work to my company. I see you need a studio built. All right."
"#02311","Just leave it to me."
"#02312","Whew... That took a while, but we're finally finished!"
"#02313","You know who to call when you need stuff built. Got to put all that empty land to good use, right? See you!"

"#02387","Here we have all sorts of details about our production team. Choose people to train."
"#02388","The higher everyone's levels, the better movie they'll make, but the cost will also go up."

"#02398","It comes with a certain cost, of course, but let me assure you it's worth every penny!"
"#02399","Hello! What will it be? Do you want me to expand <company>'s area?"
"#02400","Our new movie is out. Let's take a look at worldwide rankings to see how we're doing!"

"#02422","Here you can check details of our facilities and upgrade them too."
"#02423","Upgrading enhances facility effects."
"#02424","It's good to get that done when you have some spare cash lying around."
"#02425","Speak with people walking around the studio to hire them."
"#02426","It's more cost effective for us to sign contracts with actors and staff rather than having them do one-off jobs."
"#02427","Also, you get Research Points whenever you talk to someone new."
"#02428","Did you notice that staff have their own skills? They contribute to production in various ways."
"#02429","You can also spend Research Points to teach new skills to staff."
"#02430","Sending staff to training activities can improve their abilities."
"#02431","Sometimes you can also get rewards for it, so it's worth giving it a try!"
"#02432","How do you do? I'm the representative of a movie theater chain."

"#02446","Oh, actually..."
"#02447","It's already time for the Year 20 score calculation!"
"#02448","Fingers crossed we did well!"
"#02449","Well done successfully managing your movie studio for two whole decades."
"#02450","If you start a new game in a different save slot, you can keep some of the data from your previous playthrough, making it a little easier for you."
"#02451","Also..."
"#02452","You can keep managing <company> as long as you like, aiming ever higher!"
"#02453","That's a good title. I got everything arranged for a preview screening. I hope the audience will love it!"
"#02454","Here's a list of available actors."
"#02455","These will not cost you extra when you choose them to star in your productions."
"#02456","Use a filming site multiple times and eventually it will become a tourist spot."
"#02457","The themes that can be discovered depend on location, so try filming in different places."
"#02458","Here's a list of movies currently in production."
"#02459","Movies have several different stats. Generally, higher stats mean the audience is more likely to enjoy the film."
"#02460","<0> won the <1>!"
"#02461","We got a <2>-week extension to screenings! More people will get to see this movie!"
"#02462","=#02460"
"#02463","Staff earned more EXP than usual!"
"#02464","We didn't win any awards this time..."
"#02465","Let's work on making higher-quality movies so that next time we'll be the winners."
"#02466","We didn't win any awards but <0> got the <1> nomination!"
"#02467","That's nothing to scoff at, and we get more EXP thanks to it!"
"#02468","Hello! There's a lot of interest in one of your filming sites lately, so with your permission, I'd like to organize bus tours to it!"
"#02469","I'm sure the tourists would also like to check out your studio. Perhaps you could consider installing some tourist-oriented facilities?"
"#02470","Looking forward to more good stuff from you!"
"#02471","Thank you for hiring me as a director. I promise I'll make your next movie a success!"
"#02472","Thank you for hiring me as a director. I'll do my best!"
"#02473","Thank you for hiring me as a director. Now I can finally make use of all those ideas I had for movies!"
"#02474","Thank you for hiring me as a director. I'll prove to you that you've made the right choice picking me!"
"#02475","Thank you for hiring me as a director. Hehe... With me on the team, you can be sure of success!"
"#02476","Thank you for hiring me as a director. You can count on me!"
"#02477","Thank you for hiring me as a director. I'm itching to get started!"
"#02478","Where shall we do most of our filming? Choose a site."
"#02479","Boss, which filming site would you like to use this time?"
"#02480","Now select the filming location. Pick somewhere that will work well with the selected genre and theme."
"#02481","Where shall we film?"
"#02482","Let's select the filming location. It's okay to go slightly over budget, if you wish."
"#02483","Now, as for the filming site... We need somewhere visually appealing, a quality spot!"
"#02484","That's a neat score we got! With that, we should expect to sell lots of tickets."
"#02485","I'll speak with the movie theater people to get everything arranged for the official release."
"#02486","Critics have reviewed our latest movie. Now, let's see how that translates into ticket sales!"
"#02487","It's so satisfying to get good reviews, isn't it? I hope going forward, all our productions get showered with praise!"
"#02488","It'll be interesting to see how much the reviews actually affect the popularity of our movie!"
"#02489","I've found out that theaters are likely to extend screening periods if the reviews we get are positive."
"#02490","Movie critics can have very high standards... But at least we got some points for our latest production!"
"#02491","The director seems to be having trouble with the film's theme. Maybe you can offer some advice?"
"#02492","The director would like to ask you for advice."
"#02493","The director needs your advice. Just go with your instincts!"
"#02494","=#02491"
"#02495","Hello! Here you can make deals with movie theaters and strengthen your ties with them."
"#02496","That's how you can ensure access to a bigger audience and more ticket sales. A small fee will be deducted from each ticket sold, though."
"#02497","Why not start by strengthening your relationship with the local movie theater?"
"#02498","Hello! Would you like to upgrade your movie theater deals?"
"#02499","It's time to choose a title for our new movie. What shall we go for?"
"#02500","The production is complete. Now we just need to come up with a title!"
"#02501","The movie turned out quite well, if I may say so myself. What will we call it?"
"#02502","Now we just need a title. Choose something nice!"
"#02503","Next, we need to settle on a title. You can leave this to me if you like -- just tap the icon on the bottom left."
"#02504","You don't have enough money..."
"#02505","I'm the script writer for <0>. Rest assured I have plenty of great ideas for it already!"
"#02506","I'll be writing the script for <0>. I've been poring over the thesaurus learning obscure words just for this day!"
"#02507","Thanks for choosing me as the script writer for <0>! I won't disappoint you!"
"#02508","I'm really honored to be the script writer for <0>. I hope to fulfill, if not exceed, your expectations!"
"#02509","I'll be writing the script for <0>. I've already scribbled down some notes for the story."
"#02510","I'm in charge of special effects for <0>. I'll do all I can to add some zing to your movie!"
"#02511","Just let me work my magic and <0> will surely turn out great!"
"#02512","I'm the special effects director for <0>. I've been dreaming of getting this job!"
"#02513","Reality can be boring -- that's where special effects come into play! I'll take <0> to the next level, boss!"
"#02514","I'll use all the tricks of my trade to make <0> visually stunning!"
"#02515","I'm the music director for <0>. Allow me to jump straight into it, I already feel a surge of inspiration coming!"
"#02516","The perfect music for <0> is already playing in my mind. Need to write it down before I forget!"
"#02517","My muses are already whispering into my ears... Or is it just tinnitus? Anyway, I better start composing for <0> right away!"
"#02518","My music will breathe life into <0>!"
"#02519","I'm in charge of music direction for <0>. I'll make it epic!"
"#02520","I'm the editor on the <0> project. No bad takes can get past me!"
"#02521","I'll be editing <0>. I'll polish the filmed scenes into a high shine, like an expensive pair of shoes!"
"#02522","I've been assigned as editor to <0>. Already have some ideas for improvements!"
"#02523","I promise to do a fine editing job on <0>!"
"#02524","Got some news about <0>!"
"#02525","It's currently #<1> in the ranking! Well, how about that!"
"#02526","Looks like we're doing something right. Let's keep it up!"
"#02527","Oh, nice! We're #<1>!"
"#02528","Think we can do even better next time? Let's aim high!"
"#02529","Oh... We were so close!"
"#02530","Amazing! We've ranked # <1>!"
"#02531","Don't mind me jumping for joy!"
"#02532","We've ranked up, and now we can have up to two themes for each film!"
"#02533","That'll allow us to add more depth to the stories."
"#02534","Plus, we'll also have more ways of promoting our productions!"
"#02535","We've ranked up, and now we can have two leads at once!"
"#02536","We've ranked up, and now we can select two genres at once!"
"#02537","We've ranked up, and now we can have two supporting actors at once!"
"#02538","We've ranked up, and now we have new ways of promoting our productions!"
"#02539","Nothing to build."
"#02540","We don't have the capacity for another production."
"#02541","Our first movie is now complete, and we've had no hiccups on the way!"
"#02542","And would you believe it that it's already a year since you started up this studio?"
"#02543","You got some money out of it! Sending staff to training activities is a good idea when you're strapped for movie production funds."
"#02544","Staff skills come in handy during production. If you discover any new skills, make sure you assign them to your staff."
"#02545","We'll need to make deals with movie theaters if we want to sell more tickets."
"#02546","It's not free, of course, so let's save up some funds for that."
"#02547","Speak to staff you see in town to offer them contracts."
"#02548","Contracted staff don't cost us anything extra when we assign them to projects, so it's good to keep an in-house team!"
"#02549","The upfront cost is high, though, so let's hire people gradually, when we can afford it."
"#02550","It's important to promote our movies to boost ticket sales. Invest in promotion whenever you can!"
"#02551","We don't currently have any new potential filming sites."
"#02552","Hmm... We don't meet the requirements for upgrading yet."
"#02553","Our movies need to get a little better first!"
"#02554","Yay! We've cleared the upgrade requirements!"
"#02555","Take a look at the kind of ticket sales you can expect now."
"#02556","Uh-oh... We're running low on Research Points."
"#02557","Let me speak with the chairman..."
"#02558","Dear me, it seems you could use some help."
"#02559","I've had all these Research Points stashed away in the attic. You can have them."
"#02560","They're used for training your staff and teaching them skills."
"#02561","You can get Research Points from certain facilities. If you have space around your studio, why not install some?"
"#02562","Hmm... Looks like we've collected a fair few Research Points."
"#02563","It may be a good idea to send the director to training activities to get their stats up."
"#02564","Visit the studio and select the director."
"#02565","Hmm... We have a good amount of Research Points stocked up."
"#02566","Could spend them on teaching skills to the staff."
"#02567","Let's start with the director, shall we?"
"#02568","Hmm... We've got all these Research Points now."
"#02569","Help your staff get better by sending them to training activities and having them learn skills!"
"#02570","Oh no... Our funds are running low."
"#02571","This isn't looking good for us..."
"#02572","I tried crowdfunding just to see how it works, and the donations exceeded my wildest dreams."
"#02573","I don't mind sharing some with you."
"#02574","Save up some money to invest in getting new filming sites and hiring talented staff."
"#02575","Of course, the way to make money is through producing good movies!"
"#02576","Our finances are in good shape now. We can keep making movies without stressing out over tight budget!"
"#02577","Let's focus on making hits that will sell a lot of tickets!"
"#02578","Everything's going smoothly. Let's keep delivering quality movies to all those cinema lovers out there!"
"#02579","Our new facility has got new staff interested in our studio!"
"#02580","Our new facility has got new actors interested in <company>!"
"#02581","Boss! Our movie currently in theaters is selling lots of tickets!"
"#02582","Our movie currently in theaters is selling lots of tickets!"
"#02583","The annual National Motion Picture Award ceremony takes place soon."
"#02584","And guess what? Our movie has received a nomination, which means we're invited!"
"#02585","Let's go to the venue and see if any of our staff or actors win!"
"#02586","The annual European Motion Picture Award ceremony takes place soon."
"#02587","The annual North American Motion Picture Award ceremony takes place soon."
"#02588","The annual Asian Motion Picture Award ceremony takes place soon."

"#02594","We're not guaranteed to win anything, but I've got high hopes!"
"#02595","The Fall International Film Festival is on."
"#02596","The Winter International Film Festival is on."
"#02597","The Spring International Film Festival is on."
"#02598","I'm even more excited for it than usual... Well, let's see what we get!"
"#02599","The National Motion Picture Award ceremony is coming up."
"#02600","Unfortunately, we haven't been nominated this year. Maybe our next movie will make the cut!"
"#02601","The European Motion Picture Award ceremony is coming up."
"#02602","The North American Motion Picture Award ceremony is coming up."
"#02603","The Asian Motion Picture Award ceremony is coming up."
"#02604","The South American Motion Picture Award ceremony is coming up."
