"#00546","<co=0066cc>Pocket League Story 2</co><br>In this game you take on the role of a soccer club owner trying to create the perfect team. Train your players and compete with the world's best!"
,"▼ Game Flow<br>As club owner, you will hire and train players as you try to win all of your matches. Upgrade your team facilities and sign with new sponsors to get more money to help you on your way."
,"▼ Matches (1/2)<br>Matches are played out automatically, but you can occasionally issue tactical instructions to your team. You can also make up to three player substitutions during a match."
,"▼ Matches (2/2)<br>League matches are round-robin, while tournaments are knockout-style. There are special one-off matches as well. You can earn special bonuses based on how you win (e.g., a large goal difference)."
,"▼ Player Stats (1/2)<br>Stamina: When low, players are sluggish<br>Kick: Shot speed/pass strength<br>Speed: Running speed<br>Technique: Precision of play<br>Body: Fend off tackles and collisions<br>Keeper: Goalkeeping skill"
,"▼ Player Stats (2/2)<br>All stats (excluding Stamina) are rated on a scale of A to G. Assign players to the positions they're best at and they should shine on the field."
,"▼ Players (1/3)<br>Some players have particular talents and are designated strikers or ""exceptional players."" These talents determine how easy the player is to train as well as final stats attained at Level 30 (the maximum)."
,"▼ Players (2/3)<br>Players get paid each time they participate in a match. Their salaries rise as they play more matches. If a player doesn't play, you don't have to pay."
,"▼ Players (3/3)<br>Players are evaluated during each match. Consistently high evaluations and popularity can lead to such benefits as Best Eleven player accolades or being selected for the national team."
,"▼ Skills<br>You can teach your players a range of soccer skills through the use of special items. Equip your players with as many skills as possible and give them the competitive edge!"
,"▼ Items<br>Items have various effects on your players. They can be purchased at the item shop or won in matches. Think carefully when deciding who to use a particular item on."
,"▼ Category Changes<br>Player talents (such as ""Average"" or ""Exceptional"") can be changed using rare items, but only for team members who are Level 20 or above. Choosing a more advanced talent requires a more powerful item."
,"▼ Fatigue<br>Players grow fatigued as they practice and play matches, sometimes leading to serious injury. You can ease players' fatigue by changing coaching strategies or by having them rest in the team facilities."
,"▼ Injuries<br>Players who are seriously injured can still play but won't be at their best, gain experience points, or otherwise improve. Try to avoid injuries!"
,"▼ Falling Down<br>When a player's balance gauge reaches zero due to a collision with another player, they will fall down. This will increase their Aura gauge. Try boosting your players' Body and Speed stats as a preventative measure."
,"▼ Auras<br>When a player falls down, their Aura gauge goes up, eventually allowing them to activate an Aura. This amplifies their abilities, but activating it at the right time is key."
,"▼ Coaches<br>Coaches exert an influence on the amount of experience points players earn in training as well as the contents of treasure chests . They are paid a salary each month and level up once a year (depending on their performance)."
,"▼ Training Players<br>You can hold special training sessions for three players at a time. Effects vary according to the players' talents and the type of training chosen. The combination of players training together impacts effectiveness as well."
,"▼ Research Points<br>Research points are required for a variety of things and include two types: light bulbs and hearts. Collect them by playing in matches or using facilities. The quality of your coach and team facilities is crucial."
,"▼ Formations<br>You can choose different player formations to use in different situations. You can sometimes discover new formations by changing your coach at the end of the year."
,"▼ Starting Members & Substitutions<br>The players used at kickoff are your starting members. You can change them via the ""Lineup"" menu. Even if you make substitutions along the way, you will still use your original starting members in the next match."
,"▼ Hiring Players<br>If negotiations go well, you can hire a new player to strengthen your team. A high team evaluation and number of fans will make negotiations go more smoothly. Hiring players is the best shortcut to making a stronger team."
,"▼ Facilities<br>Players get research points by using facilities. Depending on the practice strategy used, more players will be able to use facilities. A player's Aura gauge fills up a bit while using a facility."
,"▼ Shop<br>As you make progress in the game, you will be able to access the item shop. Items come in several times throughout each game year. The quality and range of goods on offer will improve as your team rank goes up."
,"▼ Lucky Target<br>At a certain point in the game, you'll be able to access the Lucky Target store, where you can win a variety of fabulous prizes. The more you play, the better the prizes will be."
,"▼ Sponsors (1/2)<br>Sign with a sponsor and you'll get a bonus for every match, so try to get as many as possible. A high team evaluation and lots of fans make negotiations easier."
,"▼Sponsors (2/2)<br>Select a main sponsor to activate that sponsor's special skill, giving you an edge on the field. Your main sponsor will develop with each match you play. Once you select a main sponsor, you can't change it for several months."
,"▼ Fan Activities<br>Fan activities are a way for a team to connect with fans in their area. Some activities may let you discover new coaches or players."
,"▼ Scouting Level<br>The higher your team's scouting level, the better the players you will be able to discover. Use fan activities to increase your scouting level."
,"▼ Cup Matches<br>There are two kinds of cup matches: one-on-one matches and tournaments. You win a tournament by winning a set number of matches. This requires skill."
,"▼ League Matches<br>When you become a league champion, you may get access to another league. Some leagues cannot be discovered unless you win a tournament."
,"▼ Treasure Chests<br>Getting knocked down or failing to block shots can help players discover unexpected treasures. The skill of their coach can affect what they find within."
,"▼ Weather and Ground Types<br>Each stadium differs in terms of weather, field type, and so on. Certain players perform better than others in particular environments. Some skills can help overcome adverse conditions."
,"▼ Fan Base<br>Playing in matches or performing fan activities will increase a team's fan base. This greatly increases the spectators at your matches. More fans means more income."
,"▼ Support<br>Playing in matches or performing fan activities increases your support. This affects the number of fans who come to a match and how much a player's Aura gauge increases when they fall down."
,"▼ Contract Renewal<br>Coach contracts are renewed at the end of the year. Player contracts can be canceled at any time. You can have up to 40 players, but try to empty out some player slots before you get too many."
,"▼ Team Evaluation<br>Evaluation is affected by your win/loss record. Beat a higher ranked team to boost your evaluation. When your evaluation gets to a certain point, your team rank will go up."
,"▼ Friends<br>Add friends to your friends list by entering their IDs. You can compete against each other once you've attained a team rank of at least 5. Doing so earns your opponent coins."
,"▼ Friends' Players<br>You can hire players from a friend's team at any time once they reach a team rank of 2. Train them and use them in matches freely. This won't affect your friend's data."
,"▼ Friend Bonus<br>You get bonus coins for the first ten friends you register. There's no bonus for additional friends registered."
,"▼ Original Players Online<br>Once you attain a team rank of 2, your original players are registered online and will appear in your friends' games. Your players' data is updated as you compete against friends or other users."
,"▼ Online Matches<br>Once you gain a team rank of 5, you can compete against friends and other users online. Each match consumes 1 online stamina point. Win and you'll earn bonuses!"
,"▼ Leaderboards<br>Teams that have won a certain number of matches by Monday of each week advance in rank to compete against stronger teams. Can you make it to the top?"
,"▼ Purchasing Coins<br>As you progress through the game, you'll be able to buy coins at the coin shop with real money. You can also gradually earn coins by competing against friends online."
,"▼ Play Time Bonus<br>You get a bonus of 1 coin for every ten minutes of play time when you resume the game from the title screen. This excludes time spent with menus open or while your team's actions are otherwise paused."
,"▼ Game Ending<br>Your Clear Points are calculated at the end of the third month of the 16th game year. You can compete against users around the world for the best score until then. Afterward, you can keep playing for as long as you like."
,"▼ Other<br>If you start a new game after reaching the ending, you can transfer some of your data over, making it easier to get a better high score the next time. Note: Coins do not transfer over."

"#00819","Amateur Champs!"
"#00820","   The <0> are the new champions of the Amateur League! Word of this fledgling team's victory has spread like wildfire throughout the soccer world, propelling the <0> to instant fame.<br>     ""They're a very promising team. We'll have to ask them to consider joining our league. It could be just what we need to breathe a little life into it,"" said one league official, who asked to remain anonymous.<br>   It looks like all eyes will be on the <0> in the days to come."
"#00821","Regional Champs!"
"#00822","   After a triumphant win, the <0> are the new Regional League champions. They've undoubtedly set their sights on National Divsion II as the next step in their quest to become the best in the nation. The town is already abuzz with speculation.<br>   Other teams in the league have wasted no time in checking out the new competition. Even one of our reporters found himself grilled by several coaches for information. Rival teams are apparently hunting for any detail that could help formulate new strategies against the newcomers.<br> We wish the <0> luck. They'll need it."
"#00823","National Champs!"
"#00824","   The recently formed <0> sit atop National Division I for the first time, after an impressive showing in the finals earned them the championship.<br>   The assistant coach couldn't hold back her tears. ""We all worked so hard to get here,"" she said, ""but nobody has worked harder than our team's owner.""<br>   Rumor has it that this victory has brought the <0> to the attention of league managers around the world. The team has certainly gained our respect, and we offer our congratulations. Well done!"
"#00825","Contract Chaos"
"#00826","   The <0> conducted their first ever contract renewal negotiations at the end of last year. The club's owner was faced with some difficult choices that would affect the team this season, including whether or not to keep the current coach on board.<br>   A team's coach plays a vital role. They influence how much experience players get from practice, as well as how many research points are earned after each match. Coaches can help teams discover new formations. We have also heard that coaches with a demonstrated performance record become familiar with their team and increase in level.<br>  We can't help but wonder which team will be best prepared to face their opponents on the field this season. The competition will have us on the edge of our seats!"
"#00827","Auras 101"
"#00828","   Are you familiar with Auras? Whenever players get knocked to the ground during a match, their Aura gauges go up slightly. Players competing with a fully charged, activated Aura experience a marked improvement in performance.<br>   ""Auras don't last forever,"" said renowned soccer commentator Ray Rudson. ""Using them right after kickoff is probably most effective.""<br>   We recommend taking advantage of Auras, especially during important matches."
"#00829","Formations"
"#00830","   Formations are one of the more interesting aspects of soccer. One key to effective team strategy is experimenting to see which formations work best in a given situation.<br>   Some coaches prefer to tailor their formations to their opponents. They take a more defensive route when facing an aggressive team, and opt for an offensive strategy when up against a team that plays more conservatively."
"#00831","Player Stats"
"#00832","    Some players say that building up your body is the key to success, while others claim that if you increase your speed, no one will be able to touch you. Although it's easy to assume that simply improving a player's kicking ability will lead to more goals, adopting a more balanced approach is usually best. Indeed, one of the most important coaching responsibilities is deciding how to best train players."
"#00833","Team Facilities"
"#00834","   The quality of a team's facilities serves as one barometer of its team's abilities. Using team facilities earns players research points and builds up their Auras and stats. The facilities themselves can also be upgraded, speeding up players' progress.<br>   The Blue Stars are widely considered to have the best facilities in the country. ""We get plenty of visitors every day,"" said a team spokesman. ""You can ride the ponies and enjoy our famous ice cream. Our zoo is a bit empty at the moment, but we're currently in talks to bring in a panda or two.""<br>   While the Blue Stars may have gone a bit overboard, we do encourage all team owners to provide players with the facilities they need."
"#00835","Training Strategies"
"#00836","   A coach's instructions are paramount to the success of a team. Various training strategies are available, ranging from a focus on facilities to special practice sessions aimed at honing specific players' skills.<br>   Also, a word about fatigue: always try to have fatigued players rest and relax. Inadvertently overworking exhausted players has led to countless injuries.<br>  Consulting with the coach on appropriate training strategies is part of a club owner's primary responsibilities."
"#00837","Pay Up!"
"#00838","   Is your team having trouble making ends meet? For this special report, we spoke to Kirk Fellows, a management consultant and all-around man's man.<br>   ""First, remember that you only need to pay players who actually participated in the match,"" commented Fellows. ""In other words, you don't owe a thing to those who stay on the bench! Running low on funds recently? One solution is to not send out the more expensive players. It's the kind of shrewd planning that made me the man I am today! Well, before my company went belly up, that is.""<br>   Some famous teams never seem to stop hiring new players and accumulating research points. Figuring out how to manage your finances is your shortcut to the big time."
"#00839","A New Team is Born!"
"#00840","   There's a new soccer team on the block: the <0>. The quiet neighborhood streets they call home are a far cry from the bustle of the big city, but with the entire local community behind them, you can rest assured they're not alone. ""I hope they provide a boost to our economy,"" said a local cheesemaker. ""Business is slow these days.""<br>   The players took their first steps as a team recently with their debut match. ""I can't say that we're completely happy with how things went,"" the team's owner admitted. ""But it's a start, and we'll be working hard to impress our supporters in the future.""<br>   We will definitely be following this new team's progress with interest."
"#00841","10 Wins Already!"
"#00842","   Today we'd like to talk about the <0>. The team has been performing very well recently, racking up 10 wins despite some formidable rivals.<br>   ""That match was so intense! My palms were sweaty and I just couldn't sit still,"" said an excited spectator at a recent game. ""But they managed to pull off a win in the end. It was incredible!"" A section of metal fencing near the avid fan's seat was later reported bent out of shape, but no word on whether or not this was intentional.<br>   Observers are astonished at the fact that a relatively new team is performing so well. ""The <0> could be the team to beat in the future. We'd better pay attention,"" said a rival coach. Indeed, we're all very interested in how the <0> fare from now on."
"#00843","50-Win Wonder"
"#00844","   In what must surely be a record-breaking feat (given the club's relatively short history), the <0> have already racked up 50 wins. While many other teams are doing it tough, these newcomers have managed to find their groove.<br>   ""Our team is gaining recognition all around the country. Nothing could make us prouder,"" said one local supporter.<br>   <0> is certainly the team to watch this season."
"#00845","5,000 Fans!"
"#00846","   We've just learned that the <0> now have an impressive 5,000 fans.<br>   ""It seems like the number grows with every match,"" said a bemused player hanging his uniform out to dry. ""It's incredible.""<br>   But there's still room for growth, according to one industry consultant. ""They could boost that by at least 30%, easy. They just have to hire me! If you could just take my card--"" he said, shortly before being ejected from the locker room.<br>   If the <0> can maintain the momentum they've built up, who knows how far they will go!"
"#00847","100,000 Fans!"
"#00848","   This just in: the number of <0> fans has reached an incredible 100,000!<br>   The 100,000th fan, Jimmy Pinzler (11), looked surprised but happy when he was told the news and given his prize. ""I can't believe it! I've never won anything in my life. Um, so you don't have a bag for these or anything? I'm just supposed to carry them like this? Okay... thanks,"" he said, struggling to hold on to his ten new autographed soccer balls. We understand he lost all but two on the way home, but even so, this will no doubt be an experience he will never forget."
"#00849","The Palmgreasers are Out!"
"#00850","   In an unprecedented move, soccer officials have ordered the disbandment of the Palmgreasers.<br>   Although notorious for playing hard and fast with the rules, few expected such a dramatic decision--least of all the Palmgreasers themselves.<br>   ""They said what? We haven't been notified in writing, so as far as I'm concerned it hasn't happened. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some calls to make,"" said a shocked team official.<br>   ""I never expected them to just get kicked out like that,"" said one industry insider. ""All of their fans have already defected to other teams. I've never seen anything like it.""<br>   Although it goes without saying, we encourage team owners wishing to avoid a similar fate to observe game and club rules."
"#00851","Player Positions"
"#00852","   Today's feature is about player positions on the field. We asked various coaches to offer their insights into this vital aspect of the game.<br>   ""I don't worry too much about positions like FW or MF; I just try to assign players according to their abilities,"" said one coach, echoing a common opinion among those asked.<br>   Indeed, a simple change in position can yield unexpected, amazing results. <br>   ""I think experimenting with different positions really helps,"" said a student near our offices, who spoke for nearly two hours on the subject.<br>   Have you tried changing your players' positions?"

,"We may be a new team, but if we work hard, I think we can go all the way!"
,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do."
"#01634","I see you've met the coach. <br>All right, time to get down to business!"
,"To build up the team, why don't we try <co=3366ff>hiring some players</co>?"
,"Go ahead and start the contract talks by selecting ""<co=3366ff>Manage Team</co>"" from the menu."
"#01635","Since we're only a new club, we're not allowed to play in matches just yet. Wait a little bit longer!"
"#01636","I just got word that our application to form an official team has been approved!"
,"Now we can play in matches."
,"Select ""<co=3366ff>Matches</co>""<co=3366ff> </co>from the menu to play a practice match!"

,"Good luck!"
"#01644","Our first goal!"
"#01645","You've set your offense to ""long pass."" With this strategy, you use long passes to"

"#01672","You can negotiate with <0> players."
"#01673","There are no players on the hiring list."

"#01679","Wow!"
,"We got a Lucky Target ticket!"
"#01680","Let's try again some other time."
"#01681","That was a huge win!"

"#01685","Oh, <0> is in the middle of a fan activity."
"#01686","Only <co=3366ff>one player</co> can equip the ""Captain"" skill."

,"They used to say the devil himself couldn't stop one of my kicks! I look forward to showing you!"
"#01964","To tell you the truth, I never thought I would want to join the <0>."
,"But now that I'm here, I'll do whatever I can to make this the strongest team around!"
"#01965","Hello. I'm very happy to be on your team."
,"I plan to give my all to the game; if we bring home the championship, well, that's even better!"
"#01966","Hey there."
,"I hope my amazing concentration and impenetrable defense will be of some use to the team."
,"I'll do my best."
"#01967","Woo-hoo! I'm so happy to be here!"
,"So happy that I accidentally pulled the doorknob right off the bathroom door last night!"
,"I'll do my best for you! Right after I fix that door..."
"#01968","Good evening."
,"My prayers were finally answered! This is like a dream!"
,"Let's get to work!"
"#01969","Hello... I'm happy to join your team, but...I'm a little nervous."
,"My hands are shaking... I can't even tie my shoes... But I'm sure I'll be fine once I'm out on the field."
,"I look forward to working together."
"#01970","Hi! I've been interested in the <0> ever since the coach introduced me to you."
,"I'll do my best to help us win!"
"#01971","Nice to meet you! You chose the right guy to help turn this team around!"
,"Don't worry! I'll whip them into shape!"
"#01972","Hola! Me llamo Silva. Benjamin Silva."
,"Not bad, right? I've been studying foreign languages so I'll be ready no matter where I have to go."
,"Maybe I should learn more than just ""Hello"" and ""my name is..."""
"#01973","La-la-la! What a glorious day we're having!"
,"I'm so lucky to have my dream of joining a soccer team come true on a day like this!"
,"Maybe I should go buy a lottery ticket or something! I feel fantastic!"
"#01974","Well, well! I got myself quite a deal on my contract!"
,"Unsurprising, considering you beat out 34 other teams to get me!"
,"You won't regret this!"
"#01975","Hello..."
,"........."
,"I'm kind of shy... I hope I can make friends with everybody... Anyway, see you around..."
"#01976","Heh. Having me around will really seal the deal for you..."
,"It's almost unfair to the other teams!"
,"I look forward to working with you!"
"#01977","Buongiorno! Oh, I mean ""Hello!"""
,"I spent a long time overseas, but I decided to finally come home."
,"Now I can finally catch up on my favorite shows! Er, and play soccer!"
"#01978","Hello! Not only did I sign a contract with you, but I also found a new place to live!"
,"The rent is cheap and it's a nice, spacious apartment--the kind that big shots live in!"
,"Now I just have to get to work decorating the place!"
"#01979","Hiya. Nice to meet you."
,"To celebrate the new contract, I went out and partied all night with my friends!"
,"Guess I'll have to cut that out now that I'm in training..."
"#01980","Joining the <0> is like a dream come true!"
,"I'll do all I can to make our fans' dreams come true too!"
"#01981","Thanks for choosing me."
,"I'll do my best to help us win!"
"#01982","Thank you."
,"Now I should be able to pay off my student loans in about twenty years."
,"I look forward to working with you."
"#01983","It's good to see you again."
,"We worked together in the last game, right? I've been out of the picture since then."
,"Looking forward to working with you again."
"#01984","Hello."
,"They say you have a lot of fans here. Do you have air conditioning as well? Haha!"
,"I look forward to working with you."
"#01985","Nice meet you!"
,"I was sitting on the airplane for so long, my bottom broke! Look, it's got a big crack in it! Ha!"
,"But don't worry. I can still play!"
"#01986","Greetings!"

"#01992","Yes! I finally got into my dream team: the Bananas!"

"#01993","Hi."

"#01994","Hello."
,"I came here to be best in world. I hate lose game!"

"#01996","Hi there."
,"The <0> are perfect for my style."
,"Just pass me the ball and leave the rest to me."
"#01997","Hello."
,"I decided to join you when I saw how great your facilities were. I scored 100 goals for my last team, you know."
,"I'll try to do even better for the <0>!"
"#01998","Hello. I've been dreaming of joining the Bananas ever since I was a kid!"
,"...Huh? The <0>? Ah, right. That's what I meant."
,"I'll do my best for the Ba--I mean the <0>..."
"#01999","I heard you have all the ham you can eat here!"
,"I can't wait to win a trophy and turn it into a gravy boat!"
,"Bon appetit!"
"#02000","Nice to meet you!"
,"I was scouted at a school soccer game, but I never thought it would lead to this. I'll do my best to keep up!"
,"Thanks!"
"#02001","Nice to meet you!"
,"I may be small, but don't underestimate me! I drink milk every day, you know!"
,"Thanks!"
"#02002","Nice to meet you!"
,"I'm actually an actor. I played a kid soccer player in a movie and somehow I got scouted."
,"I'll have to work on learning the rules of the game, but I'm sure it'll be fine..."
"#02003","Nice to meet you!"
,"You know when people say they have a ""tight six pack""?"
,"I always thought they were talking about soda!"
"#02004","Nice to meet you!"
,"I want to save my money so I can buy some new dentures for my grandpa!"
"#02005","Ugh... Hello..."
,"I'm still a little jet-lagged. But I think I'm about 60% recovered, so no worries!"
,"What country is this again?"
"#02006","Hi, everybody!"
,"It's a real thrill for me to be a part of a team like this!"
"#02007","Hello."
,"You made a great choice with me! I'm a genuine soccer master!"
,"I'll do whatever it takes to make those baskets! Touchdowns? Goals! That's it!"
"#02008","Hello."
,"I'm trying to be a musician, but I thought I'd try my hand at being a soccer player too. Or should I say ""my foot""?"
,"I want to make a lot of goals and get lots of fans."
"#02009","Nice to meet you!"
,"I came a long way just to be a soccer player."
,"I hope to get a lot of points. Maybe even pull off a hat trick!"
"#02010","I look forward to working with you!"
,"I'm really better at baseball than soccer, but I'll try my best to learn the rules!"
,"Thanks!"
"#02011","Hello again. I was impressed by how honest and forthright you were when negotiating with me."
,"""Forthright"" is the word, yes? My English is--how do you say--less than perfect."
,"I look forward to working with you in the future."
"#02012","Hahaha! You did well to snap me up for your team!"
,"Just remember: I'm in it to win it!"
,"I'll give 110% to this team! Even though that's mathematically impossible!"
"#02013","Hello."
,"I've been in this country for some 18 years now. I think I'm finally getting the hang of English."
,"I'll work hard for the team!"
"#02014","I look forward to working with you!"
,"Maybe if I impress you as a player, you'll let me put my company's name on the uniforms!"
,"I'll do my best!"
"#02015","Hello."
,"I haven't been in your country long, but I'll do my best!"

,"I'll do my best to make us champions!"
"#02019","Hello! Joining your team is a dream come true, <0>!"
