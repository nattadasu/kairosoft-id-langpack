"#02195","The park in <town> is now even better than before owing to a brand new statue...of an adorable puppy! The town's management hopes that this new landmark will help to increase the daily number of visitors to the park.<br>The statue has quickly gained popularity with locals, both adults and children alike, but there are also some strange rumors going around...<br>""I live by the park and one night persistent barking woke me up... I went to check it out and saw the statue move!"" claimed one resident. Does the statue really come alive at night, only to return to its original place in the morning? We will launch our own investigation and let you know what we find!"
"#02196","Old-Timey Candy Shop"
"#02197","A small but full of character candy shop has opened in <town> near the park, which seems even livelier than before with delighted, candy-munching children. Affordable prices and plenty of choice attract kids, who quickly spend their allowance on the treats.<br>""I'm doing my bit for the community by helping the little ones learn about shopping and using money,"" crooned the elderly owner, absent-mindedly jingling coins in her pocket. <town> really is a wonderful town with inhabitants so full of good will!"
"#02198","Yummy Calories"
"#02199","Fans of pizza and donuts, rejoice! <town> now has a great pizzeria and a donut shop within walking distance. Delicious smells waft onto the streets, pulling in lots of hungry customers.<br>""I go for pizza first, and then buy donuts for dessert. But sometimes I get donuts first and then also pizza to go. I know I should eat more salad but...but..."" our interviewee rushed back into the pizzeria without finishing the sentence.<br>With more eateries to choose from, this is becoming a well-rounded town...but so are its inhabitants."
"#02200","Win Some, Withdraw More"
"#02201","<town> provides a fine example of ingenious town planning: a bank has been built next to a popular game arcade. Out of coins? Not a problem anymore. It is all too easy to pop over to the bank and withdraw more.<br>Younger customers tend to go for crane claw and arcade games, while the older pretty much monopolize slot machines and coin pushers.<br>""I came with a bagful of coins and it's all gone already,"" said one customer. ""I was this close to getting the plushie I wanted... Going to take some more money out. I'm no quitter!""<br>This set-up is doing wonders for the town's economy!"
"#02202","Local Businesses Fight Back"
"#02203","These days small shops tend to lose out to supermarkets, but the local fishmonger and greengrocer in <town> are holding their ground! They've recently started giving out free recipes with purchases, including ideas for meals kids will love as much as their parents.<br>""No supermarket can deliver the quality we do. We're getting the freshest produce directly from local suppliers,"" proudly said the greengrocer.<br>Promoting locally-sourced products helps both the shops and the farms and fisheries that supply them stay in business."
"#02204","Competition Intensifies"
"#02205","A large department store has just opened next to the supermarket in <town>! Small retailers are working together to devise a plan to keep their customers.<br>""We're not going to wave a white flag just because a big shop has opened in town. Although I shop there too now, when they have discounts...""<br>Let's hope both large and small retailers can find a way to peacefully coexist."
"#02206","Sweet Rewards for Studying"
"#02207","The cram school and candy shop in <town> have teamed up, offering discounts for sweets to the students who get high scores on tests. The incentive is expected to motivate children to study more.<br>""With so many little ones visiting my shop every day, it's a great place to meet new friends. Yes, candy shops play a vital role in the community,"" said the elderly owner and cackled with laughter."
"#02208","Game On!"
"#02209","<town> now has a game shop and a bookstore, right next to each other. The two businesses have a symbiotic relationship, driving up each other's sales, as the bookstore stocks a wide range of game magazines and guides. One customer was happy to be interviewed.<br>""This guy I had seen at the game shop a few times was next in line at the bookstore. He was buying books from an author I like as well. So we started chatting, and now we play fighting games together every weekend!""<br>These two retailers are a match made in heaven."
"#02210","Students' Safety"
"#02211","Ensuring that schools provide a safe environment for children is a priority. All teachers in <town> are required to learn kung fu, but now children can feel even safer, as a security company opened next door.<br>Parents are very pleased, and according to an unconfirmed rumor, a certain millionaire was so impressed that she donated a large amount of money to the school. The donation is to be used for free, well-balanced meals for students.<br>The town's reputation is expected to rise as a result."
"#02212","Quality Packed Lunches"
"#02213","A restaurant and Lunches 2 GO have paired up to create a brand new line of packed lunches. Now you can enjoy restaurant-quality food in convenient, microwaveable boxes. Take it to school, take it to work, take it home when you don't feel like cooking!<br><town>'s residents seem to love the ready meals as much as they do the freshly-prepared restaurant dishes."
"#02214","Discover Your Style"
"#02215","A beautician and a boutique have opened as part of <town>'s promotional campaign Express Yourself in Style.<br>Does your hairstyle go with your outfit? Does your outfit go with your make-up? Visit both shops and discover a style that suits you best. Or you could try to reinvent yourself with a completely new look!"
"#02216","Sugary Paradise"
"#02217","Sweet-toothed residents of <town> couldn't have been happier! A cakery is now open next to a donut shop. Does it make for a tough choice when the urge to eat something sweet takes you? Why not visit both!<br>The two shops even started selling products combining the best of both worlds: donut cakes and cake donuts. Don't miss out and try them both!"
"#02218","Learn to Play"
"#02219","A music shop has opened in <town>, and what's even more noteworthy is that it's located next to a school. The owner used to be in a school music club.<br>""I heard there were lots of students with an interest in music, so I picked this location. I'd like to be er...instrumental in sparking an interest in music among children and teens.""<br>Who knows, maybe the town will even produce famous musicians one day!"
"#02220","Take It Easy, Gamers"
"#02221","A gamer was hospitalized yesterday after three days without eating or drinking.<br>""The game I was waiting for all year came out, and I just couldn't stop playing it until I got to the last boss. When I finally defeated the boss, I passed out... Double KO, lol.""<br>Although we recommend not forgetting about things such as food during gaming sessions, at least <town>'s residents can rest assured that there's an excellent hospital that will nurse them back to health. We've also found out that sales of this new game have gone up since this incident."
"#02222","Can You Eat All That Meat?"
"#02223","Meat-lovers are going to be delighted to hear that now <town> has got a steakhouse right next to a barbecue restaurant. This set-up seems to work really well for both restaurants, although the trend is for the steakhouse to be frequented mostly on weekdays while the barbecue restaurant is full all weekends. We interviewed the staff.<br>""Somehow, no one ever asks for salad,"" said the puzzled waiters at both joints."
"#02224","Refreshment after Exercise"
"#02225","You need not queue for the gym showers anymore! A new public bathhouse has opened next to the gym. It's a terrific place to soak or scrub after exercise. Some customers have been seen showing off their muscular bodies at the bathhouse, striking poses while enjoying a drink of strawberry milk. There's been talk that people come to the bathhouse just to ogle the fit gym-goers... But maybe that's just what the latter want to believe in."
"#02226","Take-Out Wars"
"#02227","Things are heating up in <town> with the fast food restaurant fiercely competing for customers with Lunches 2 Go.<br>""We offer fast service, and you can choose to eat in too if you like,"" said the fast-food rep.<br>""Our lunches are nutritionally balanced and the portion sizes won't disappoint anyone,"" countered the ready-meal shop owner.<br>There is no end in sight for the rivalry between the two businesses. Hopefully it will lead to improvements in quality as each tries to surpass the other."
"#02228","Family-Friendly"
"#02229","The urban planners of <town> have shown a real knack for making the town more family-friendly by locating a diner next to a park. The diner offers an extensive children's menu, so you are guaranteed to find something even the pickiest eaters will dig into without throwing a tantrum. And the kids can burn their excessive energy at the park afterwards. Perfect!"
"#02230","Phenomenal Phones & PCs"
"#02231","Now I can get all parts I need in the same place. I'm thinking of building my own smartphone next, told an excited homebrew PC hobbyist we interviewed about the local PC and mobile phone shops. Having these two businesses next to each other is inspiring more tech-savvy customers to build their own devices."
"#02232","Cinema and Coffee"
"#02233","A classic combo of a movie theater and a coffee shop opened in <town> to public acclaim. The cafe gives out leaflets about currently shown movies, and attracts customers waiting for their shows to start."
"#02234","Fairytale Charm"
"#02235","With a shrine next to a toy shop in <town>, many local children have taken to playing on the shrine grounds. We wondered whether the local deity was upset about the noise...<br>""No, not at all. I'm a deity protecting children from harm, you see, and I'm thrilled to have them around. I wish I could play with them, but not having a physical body makes it quite difficult,"" said the otherworldly being in a dream the editorial staff saw last night. Upon waking from the shared dream, my co-workers went to buy toys at the shop as if in a trance..."
"#02236","No More Foul Smells"
"#02237","<town>'s public toilets have been decorated with flowers instead of the sudden-scare-spray air fresheners. This was the idea of the local florist.<br>""Real flowers bring out kinder feelings in people, encouraging them to behave better and not leave a mess behind,"" explained the florist. The toilet users seemed satisfied with the facilities. One more step towards making this a clean, neat town!"
"#02238","Messy Eaters, Worry No More!"
"#02239","Splat! There goes your white shirt, now covered in strawberry syrup from a delicious crepe. Does this scenario sound familiar? Well, no you need not fret any more, as there is a dry cleaner beside the creperie in <town>!<br>The town's planners have thought of everything, it seems!"
"#02240","24-7 Mart Vs Supermarket"
"#02241","Supermarket next to a 24-7 Mart? You might think it's madness, but <town>'s planners seem to know what they're doing. We interviewed customers of both.<br>""Me, I don't care about it being a few cents cheaper in the supermarket. I just can't stand wasting my life waiting in long lines at the checkouts.""<br>""I go to the supermarket, it's a no-brainer. It's super cheap!""<br>It seems each store has a devoted customer base, not that they're not trying to steal one another's!"
"#02242","Pet Shop by the Park"
"#02243","Pet owners in <town> can now take advantage of the pet shop being right outside a park. Do shopping for your furry pets, then take them out for a walk in the park! It also provides an opportunity to socialize with other pet owners, and you can also bring your kids with you for an active day out. The locals are very pleased, saying it's one more reason for this town being great to live in."
"#02244","More Fun with Games & Anime"
"#02245","An anime shop and a games shop do make for a great combination - and now we have them in <town>! The anime shop also sells comics and manga. Did you know that there are lots of games based on manga and manga based on games? Games made in an anime-style also inspire gamers to purchase anime DVDs. These two shops sell all you need entertainment-wise for a lazy Sunday in."
"#02246","Laid-Back Fishing"
"#02247","With a vending machine next to a fishing pond, local fishing enthusiasts can spend a relaxing day out without the need to bring their own drinks in coolers. Plus, there are also snacks to keep you going when you've got the munchies but don't want to leave yet.<br>""It's one of those things that add to the quality of life in <town>,"" said one of the anglers. ""It's my escape after a busy week at work. I'm loving it."""
"#02248","Animals of Land and Sea"
"#02249","You can now marvel at both land animals and marine creatures in <town>! Visit the zoo and the aquarium on the same day! The two attractions are hugely popular among people of all ages. Alongside the usual lions, elephants, sharks etc., they also feature rare critters which we recommend you go and see for yourself. It's simply impossible not to have a good time there!"
"#02250","Vroom Vroom!"
"#02251","If you like motor vehicles, you're going to love this news: there's now a motorbike shop next to a car dealer in town! Whether it's two wheels or four that you're into, you'll find something just for you. There are tourers, vans, even heavy goods vehicles. And sports cars too, of course, in which you can chase after your dreams at super high speeds."
"#02252","Tourist Support"
"#02253","We've found out that the information center by the airport is gladly used by a lot of tourists. One of them was kind enough to let us interview him.<br>""It's my first time here, so I was lost at first, but the info center staff were very helpful. This is going to be a great trip. Why did I choose to come to <town>? To buy video games which never got released in my home country.""<br>Whatever the reason you came to visit our town, we wish you a jolly good time!"
"#02254","Spa Gifts"
"#02255","<town> now features a spa next to a gift shop, which started selling spa-themed fridge magnets, keyrings, mugs and what-not! Make your spa visit all the more memorable by purchasing an original knick-knack that will sit on your shelf forever after. The spa also offers a discount to customers who buy their exclusive set of hand towels from the gift shop!"
"#02256","Monumental View"
"#02257","A spectacular monument has been erected in the vicinity of <town>'s temple, making for a postcard-worthy view. Locals are very pleased, saying the new landmark added much more splendor to their area.<br>""I've been donating pennies to the temple every now and then, for restoration work and such. To think my donations helped fund this monument! I may be a bit more extravagant from now on and donate a nickel once a year as well. Maybe they'll build an even bigger monument!"""
"#02258","From Hook to Plate"
"#02259","Catch your own fish at the fishing pond in <town>, then take it to the nearby sushi shop to have it expertly prepared and served to you! Not only does it give you the opportunity to have the freshest sushi possible, but it's also a great idea for a day out with the kids. Watch them squeal with joy as they reel in their catch, have them tire themselves out fishing so that they behave at the sushi restaurant afterwards!"
"#02260","Deals for New Residents"
"#02261","Have you just moved in? Need to buy furniture and white goods for your new home? <town>'s furniture and electricals shops have teamed up, offering amazing deals for new residents. There are special offers for families and for singles living alone too! No one's left out. Get an electronic back-scratcher for half price with every purchase! The shops also offer trade-in deals for those who simply want to change their current furnishings."
"#02262","Get Your Camping Shoes"
"#02263","The campsite management has teamed up with the nearby shoe shop to boost outdoor shoe sales and encourage greater use of the campsite. The shoe shop also offers a cleaning service for your muddy, stinky shoes! It's very affordable and you can get your cleaned shoes back on the same day.<br>Buy yourself a new pair of outdoor shoes (all sizes available) and go camping today!"
"#02264","3-Star Amusement Park"
"#02265","The amusement park in <town> has so many attractions that it's simply impossible to get enough of it within just one day. But now that a 3-star hotel opened next to it, you can stay overnight and come back for more fun next day! The hotel offers top-class accommodation at reasonable prices, and the quality of food at their restaurant is a good enough reason to book your stay by itself."
"#02266","Walking in the Clouds"
"#02267","Residents of <town> have been calling the high-rise building and skyscraper built next to each other the ""dad and son buildings."" The roofs of both are fully accessible and offer stunning views of the town. We recommend going there at night to marvel at the glittering cityscape below while enjoying star-shaped chocolates, available at the buildings' snack shops."
"#02268","Fun Nights Out"
"#02269","A casino and a dance club have opened door-to-door in <town>, quickly becoming a nightlife hotspot. Casino-goers like to finish their night at the club, partying hard in celebration of their wins, or dancing with abandon to forget about their losses. Whatever the fortunes of their customers, for the two establishments it's always a win-win deal."
"#02270","Battle Royale"
"#02271","A surprising sight has been attracting much attention in <town> lately: a castle built right next to a palace. The two landmarks represent very different styles, but having them in such close proximity makes it seem as if they were built as a challenge to one another. Will visitors head to the historical castle, or the fairytale palace? Or will they visit both, since they're so close?"
"#02272","Agritourism"
"#02273","Now is your chance to experience life on a farm without having to travel far out of the city! <town>'s farm and ranch have opened their doors to tourists and local visitors. See how your food is grown and try the fresh produce! This is also a great educational experience for kids. Remember to wear clothes you don't mind getting mud all over!"
"#02274","Swim Like a Fish"
"#02275","The local aquarium in <town> has teamed up with a swimming pool for a promotional campaign designed to encourage children to learn to swim. Visit the aquarium, then go to swimming classes and learn to swim just like the creatures of the deep blue sea! Of course, adults are also welcome, with or without children!"
"#02276","Rockets and History"
"#02277","The museum and rocket hall in <town> have launched a new cross-promotional campaign, starting with the opening of an exhibition about the history of rockets, sponsored by the rocket hall, at the museum. If the exhibition proves to be popular, a zero-gravity experience room may also be added. Let's hope those tickets sell!"
"#02278","Watch Gigs from your Sofa"
"#02279","Never miss your favorite concerts just because you have no time to go to them! With a TV station right next to the concert hall in <town>, the costs of broadcasting events have gone down, making it possible for the station to broadcast 24/7! This news has been welcomed by fans who can now watch their beloved bands perform live without the need to step out of the house."
"#02280","Send a Postcard Home"
"#02281","A new series of highly collectible postcards and stamps has been released as a result of collaboration between the spa hotel and the community center in <town>. The stamps and postcards feature famous local sights, and of course the spa hotel as well, making for wonderful reminders of relaxing vacations spent here."
"#02282","Home Cinema"
"#02283","The electricals shop in <town> is now selling a cutting-edge home cinema set, and at a bargain price! Get it today and head over to the Blogbuster to rent some movies... But don't worry if the film you wanted has already been rented out! Connect to the internet and rent out movies digitally. No hassle, no wait, no need to worry about forgetting to return the DVD and incurring a fine. Enjoy the movie theater experience at your cozy home."
"#02284","Helicopter Hype"
"#02285","There is a new attraction in <town>: short helicopter flights around the skyscraper next to the helipad. We hurried to the site at once to interview one of the first customers, a young boy, as he was getting out of the helicopter.<br>""When I grow up, I want to fly round and round taller things, like a big, big tower!""<br>Well, this young lad has certainly set his goals high!"
"#02286","For a Lovely Home"
"#02287","Notices have been posted all over the town, advertising house refurbishments and extensions, offered as a joint project by the local real estate agency and building contractors.<br>As recently it's become the norm to have less or no children, many of the town's residents have plenty of disposable income which they are more than willing to spend on making their homes stylish and comfortable. If you can afford it, why not live in a designer home!"
"#02288","Spa and Sports"
"#02289","We've finally had the chance to interview some of the most famous local athletes as they left the stadium and headed to the spa nearby. The spa is much-frequented by the sports players, who come there to unwind and undergo various treatments...as well as play table tennis in the lounge. They get fiercely competitive, it seems, and given the opportunity will play any sport...forgetting they still had their mud masks on."
"#02290","Baseball and Bathing"
"#02291","Don't you get sweaty watching exciting baseball matches, or playing yourself? Now you can wash off the grime and make yourself look presentable again at the bathhouse next to the baseball stadium! What's more, the bathhouse offers an interesting choice of refreshments: fruit or coffee-flavored milk. The owner went as far as to claim that over half of the customers visit primarily because of the milk drinks. True or not, he's certainly milking it!"
"#02292","Lucky Wish"
"#02293","As our reporter was leisurely strolling through the town in search of a newsworthy topic, she came across a crowd of people making wishes at a shrine. Upon investigation, she found that many of those who buy lottery tickets at a nearby stall visit the shrine in the hope of boosting their luck.<br>""If I win, I'm going on a trip to Austria,"" said a young man interviewed on site. ""I want to see kangaroos.""<br>Well, even if he wins, he's best chance of seeing a kangaroo in Austria is in a zoo..."
"#02294","Signals from Space"
"#02295","Can you believe it! The telecom tower picked up signals from space, which a dedicated team of code-breakers and linguists managed to decipher to mean: ""Earthlings, we want to find out what it is about pumpkin spice latte that makes you so crazy about it. Bring the latte. And muffins. Kthxbye.""<br>The rocket hall immediately began preparations to send a rocket into space...but in the middle of the take-off countdown, the scientists noticed they forgot the muffins, so the whole thing had to be called off for the time being. Regardless of the unsuccessful launch, the rocket hall and telecom tower have been attracting more visitors than usual."
"#02296","Romantic Sea Voyage"
"#02297","When a telephone box was put in by a wharf, we had our doubts as to the rationale behind that decision. But to our surprise, the phone box is nearly constantly in use!<br>""Sure, I have a cell phone like everyone else. But there's something special about turning it off, going out to sea, then coming ashore as the sun is setting and phoning back home from a booth. It's like being transported back in time, you know?"" explained a misty-eyed tourist we interviewed at the wharf, which got noticeably busier!"
"#02298","For Patients' Convenience"
"#02299","Patients' patience was being tested when there was no drugstore next to the hospital. But now, finally, they can get their prescriptions next door. We interviewed an elderly patient at the hospital lobby.<br>""I'm in poor health, and making it to the hospital was terribly exhausting for me. So if I had to walk far to get my meds, I'd probably just kick the bucket before I even got there!""<br>With a drugstore and hospital in one place, it's far more convenient for everyone."
"#02300","New Channel?!"
"#02301","A local TV station has annexed a telecoms tower, announcing that it will use the tower for broadcasting a brand new channel packed with exciting, original programs. We interviewed the TV station director to see if we could tease out any details as to this eagerly-awaited new channel...<br>""Hahaha, well... This is just between you and me, right? It won't get published? Okay, so... The truth is, we haven't yet thought about it. Yes, it's due to start next week...""<br>It's all up in the air, but let's hope for the best!"
"#02302","Bejeweled Shoppers"
"#02303","With a jewelry shop nearby, the department store has noted an influx of jewel-laden customers.<br>""If I'm going to buy new outfits at the department store, I might just as well get matching jewelry, no?""<br>""I'm like a local celebrity, ask anyone if you don't believe me. I buy at least one new ring or necklace a month, with real diamonds.""<br>The glamorous ladies we interviewed ambled off to the bargains corner at the store. It's good to see that the locals are making the best of these two shops."
"#02304","Veggie It Up"
"#02305","The popular seaside clubhouse in <town> started sourcing vegetables from the neighboring farm. We all know that the freshness of ingredients makes all the difference and indeed, the customers claim there's no better place for corn on the cob, and no one leaves the salad served alongside burgers uneaten any more.<br>   ""The clubhouse buys pretty much all my produce now,"" said the happy farmer, stuffing himself with locally-sourced calamari."
"#02306","Shiny Kairobot"
"#02307","Slightly puzzling news this time! Since the Kairobot Statue has been put next to the Kairo-building, it started emitting a strange light, and residents reported hearing noises sounding like ""Kairoooooo... Kairooooooo..."" at night. We went to investigate and managed to interview one local with an oddly square, yellow head and a hairdo resembling an antenna.<br>""Hello, and thanks for playing my games! I've got to go to work on a new one, bye!""<br>Off he went, leaving our reporters confused. Somehow, all these bizarre events seem to have only increased the popularity of these Kairo-things!"
"#02308","Sensational Tapas"
"#02309","The tapas restaurant has become incredibly popular since a group of athletes from the nearby stadium had a party after a major competition. They had a grand time and gave their autographed t-shirts to the restaurant owner, who framed them and put up on the walls.<br>We recommend the place, both for its excellent food and the chance to meet your favorite sports star. Due to the increased interest, advance bookings are required."
"#02310","Unorthodox Spa"
"#02311","The local spa now offers a revolutionary new treatment which is guaranteed to make your skin radiant and youthful. You might have read about face creams using snail gel, but why use a product loaded with preservatives when you can have actual giant snails crawl all over your face, covering it in lovely fresh goo while gently massaging it with their slimy feet? It's possible now thanks to cooperation with the local zoo, which rents out the snails to the spa."
"#02312","The Two Statues"
"#02313","Breaking news! Since the Kairobot Statue and a monument had been erected next to each other, mysterious energy started emanating from them. They seem to be reacting to one another... FLASH! Something is going on! The statue is glowing...! FLASH! There it goes again!<br>...Everything seems to have gone back to normal. Nothing special has happened but there is a sense of happiness in the air. Yet another mystery remains unsolved!"
"#02314","School Vs Games"
"#02315","Uh-oh! A game arcade right next to a school? Although the school is doing what it can to prevent students from sneaking away to the game arcade before classes are over, the kids still find a way... As a result, the average exam scores have plummeted. The game arcade staff also voiced complaints about teachers coming in for inspections, looking for students skiving lessons, which ruins the fun atmosphere for customers. It really doesn't seem like a good idea to have these two facilities next to one another!"
"#02316","Smells Like Lost Profits"
"#02317","Screams could be heard from the local boutique... The staff were in tears, putting away clothes from the hangers to have them sent off for cleaning.<br>""Everything smells of the barbecue restaurant next door. No one's going to buy a new blouse that smells like sausages!"" complained the owner, who could be barely heard over their growling stomach. A fancy fashion outlet next to a barbecue place... This isn't going to work."
"#02318","Noise Pollution"
"#02319","""This used to be a lovely, quiet little ranch..."" The rancher shook his head sadly. ""Now that there's this concert hall, you can't escape the noise. It makes me stressed, and my animals too. Then there's the littering problem, there's trash everywhere, it's awful.""<br>The concert hall staff have called an emergency meeting to propose a public awareness campaign to reduce littering, but the issue of noise remains. The concert-goers also aren't too happy about farm smells in the venue."

"#02644","Hello Boss! I'm your new secretary."
,"I'll do all I can to assist you in<br>building a world-famous town."
,"We'll have to start from scratch, though.<br>First, we need to get some <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>residents</co></co>."
,"And to do that, we'll need some empty lots<br>to build residential housing on!"
"#02645","Boss! Someone new has just<br>arrived in <town>!"
,"Our first resident! Yay!<br>Let me introduce you..."
"#02646","I have high hopes for <town>. I feel<br>like my dreams may all come true here!"
"#02647","Boss! <town> got a new resident!"
"#02648","It's time to collect rent from our residents.<br>Rent is paid per house."
"#02649","Feels good, doesn't it?"
,"And if we can increase the <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>land value</co></co><br>the rent will go up as well!"
,"Let's keep getting more residents."
"#02650","Ahh, I love April. Why? Because it's<br>the month when we collect rent! Heh!"
"#02651","We're making quite good money.<br>Let's try to increase the land value<br>to make even more next year!"
"#02652","Umm, so this is when we'd normally be<br>collecting rent and raking it in..."
,"But there are no houses in our town!<br>We need to get residents asap!"
"#02653","Greetings! Word has reached me about<br>this new town you're developing."
,"My association ranks towns based on<br>a meticulous land value assessment."
,"We give monetary awards to facilities<br>with the highest land value to further<br>stimulate town development."
,"Please consider participating in<br>our rankings."
"#02654","I took the liberty of signing up<br><town> for the ranking!"
,"Our best facility is the <0>,<br>with a land value of <1>G.<br>Let's see what rank we got!"
,"The results should be in now!"
"#02655","Not bad considering it's our<br>first year."
,"Let's <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>raise our facilities' land value</co></co><br>and try again next year!"
"#02656","It's October, when land value ranking<br>results are announced."
,"Let's see how well <town> has done<br>this year..."
,"Our best facility is <0>,<br>with a land value of <1>G.<br>Let's see what rank we got!"
"#02657","We're climbing up the ranking!"
,"Let's <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>raise our facilities' land value</co></co><br>and try again next year!"
"#02658","Here we are in October, the month that's<br>all about the land value ranking..."
,"But we have no facility to enter<br>in the ranking!"
,"Boss, we seriously need to build shops,<br>or we'll be missing out big time!"
"#02659","Open the Build menu and select<br><co=3366ff><co=168fe5>Empty Lot</co></co>. Then place it on the<br>town map."
,"We want it to be by the road."
"#02660","Nice to meet ya! We'll start the<br>construction work at once. It'll be<br>done in no time!"
,"By the way... Ya'll need more roads if<br>you want to expand the town."
,"Something like this one for starters."
"#02661","I'm advertising our town nationally,<br>so hopefully we'll see more people<br>moving in soon."
,"Let's wait a bit and see how it goes."
"#02662","Hello! I'm new here... Nice to meet you!"
,"<town> has just so much potential!"
,"Here's the move-in fee!"
"#02663","You know, I just hate waiting. Let's get<br>the construction work finished at once."
,"Let me give you these..."
"#02664","Now tap the <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>clock icon</co></co> above the house<br>to have it built without the wait!"
"#02665","Well, we're done here! All good to go."
"#02666","Boss, one of the residents seems<br>to want something."
,"<co=168fe5>Tap their house</co> to see what it's about."
"#02667","Aah, it's great to have more residents.<br>I can't wait for this place to grow into<br>a vibrant town bustling with activity!"
,"So how about preparing more <co=168fe5>Empty Lots</co>?"
"#02668","Woohoo, more residents! I'm so happy!"
,"Although... Is it just me or is our town<br>sort of...dull?"
,"I wonder what we need to make it<br>more appealing."
"#02669","Ahem... I happened to overhear<br>your conversation..."
,"Perhaps I could help you a little<br>in this matter."
,"You see, your town would greatly benefit<br>from some shops!"
"#02670","I'll follow your progress with much interest."
,"Oh, and one more thing to get you started."
"#02671","Whoa, aren't we lucky, getting all these<br>freebies! Alright, let's build some <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>shops</co></co>!"
,"Rotate the shop so that it<br><co=3366ff><co=168fe5>faces</co></co> the road."
"#02672","Well now!"
,"Your town is growing beautifully."
,"I think it would also be nice to have<br>some public space for people to relax,<br>wouldn't you agree?"
"#02673","Sweet, we can now have a pretty<br>little park!"
,"Parks are best located <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>near residential<br>housing</co></co>."
"#02674","Our residents look way happier now!"
,"Nearly forgot! I got this earlier."
"#02675","See if you can squeeze this facility<br>in between others. It raises land value."
,"So try to locate it by shops or houses."
"#02676","It finally looks like a proper town!"
,"...Except it's sort of suffocating<br>without green spaces. Access to<br>nature's important too!"
"#02677","Umm, excuse me... I was just<br>passing by. You want more nature<br>in this town?"
,"I was doing some landscaping work<br>in a nearby town and got some<br>leftover supplies. You can have them."
"#02678","Brilliant! Did you know that planting<br>trees <co=3366ff><co=168fe5>near residential houses</co></co><br>increases coziness?"
"#02679","Oh, I forgot to give you something."
,"As soon as I remembered, I hopped on<br>my moped and rushed over. Here, it's for you."
"#02680","Yay, more shops! We can enrich our town<br>and make more money while we're at it."
"#02681","Heh heh! Your town's population<br>has grown handsomely."
,"But at your current Town Rank<br>you can only have up to 6 residents."
,"If you want the town to grow,<br>you need to rank up!"
,"How to do it? You'll need to earn<br>some trophies!"
"#02682","Ho ho ho! You're after some trophies,<br>is that correct?"
,"I see you've built a neat little town here."
,"But does your town deserve to be awarded<br>a Trophy? It's up to me to decide!<br>I'll be checking in on you."
"#02683","We've ranked up! Now we can have<br>more residents."
"#02684","We've ranked up! Now we can have<br>more residents."
,"We can now build more facilities!"
"#02685","Hmm... I've been told a remarkable<br>town developer took over this place,<br>so I've come to see it for myself."
,"I own the land around your town.<br>I might be willing to give it to you...<br>Under certain conditions."
,"Interested? Then select ""Get Land""<br>and see what the conditions are."
"#02686","Boss, wouldn't it be great to get<br>more land? Think of what we could<br>build on it!"
,"Let's check what conditions we need<br>to meet and give it a try!"
"#02687","Our town's getting bigger and bigger!<br>Let's keep it up!"
"#02688","There's still plenty of land around.<br>Let's expand our town more!"
"#02689","It's February!"
"#02690","It's March!"
"#02691","It's April!"
"#02692","It's May!"
"#02693","It's June!"
"#02694","It's July!"
"#02695","It's August!"
"#02696","It's September!"
"#02697","It's October!"
"#02698","It's November!"
"#02699","It's December!"
,"Ho ho! I've brought you a gift."
"#02700","It's over a year since the town was built!"
"#02701","Well now... I came for a leisurely stroll<br>around your town and was so surprised!"
,"There are so many new buildings.<br>Well done, I am impressed."
,"Perhaps <town> would make it one day<br>to rank 100... Oh, how I'd love to see that!"
"#02702","Hello, hello! I work for the most<br>prestigious bank in the country."
,"Our reports indicate that your town's<br>residents have savings of over 50G!"
,"This is excellent for the town's economy,<br>as the residents have money to splurge<br>on whatever they like!"
,"Just my two cents, but having residents<br>do better jobs will let them make more<br>money, which makes YOU more money!"
"#02703","Hello, hello! The town's residents<br>keep getting richer! Isn't it wonderful?"
,"According our recent survey, you have<br>a resident with savings of 100G!"
,"That's just so great for your town.<br>It's so exciting to see it grow!"
"#02704","Hello, hello! The town's residents<br>keep getting richer! Isn't it wonderful?"
,"According our recent survey, you have<br>a resident with savings of 200G!"
,"That's just so great for your town.<br>It's so exciting to see it grow!"
"#02705","Hello, hello! The town's residents<br>keep getting richer! Isn't it wonderful?"
,"According our recent survey, you have<br>a resident with savings of 500G!"
,"That's just so great for your town.<br>It's so exciting to see it grow!"
"#02706","Hi!<br>I've been traveling all around the country, searching for the most valuable properties."
,"Your town has appeared out of nowhere<br>and you already have a facility worth<br>200G! Unbelievable."
,"High land value means you earn more money from a facility and have better chances in the rankings."
,"Well, you seem to be doing a great job<br>building this town. I'll leave you to it."
"#02707","Hi! I'm back again on another land value<br>survey."
,"I canceled my holidays and flew here from<br>a certain tropical island when I got a call<br>about a 400G facility you have!"
,"I've never seen a facility reach such<br>a high value in such a short time."
,"Towns with high land value properties<br>attract more residents, even ones that<br>were not initially interested at all!"
"#02708","Hi! I'm back again on another land value<br>survey."
,"I was on a Pacific cruise when news<br>reached me of a 600G facility<br>in your town. I had to come here at once!"
,"I'm thrilled about your progress here.<br>It's so exhilarating, ha ha ha!"
,"Something tells me the land value<br>in <town> will just keep going up!"
"#02709","Hi! I'm back again on another land value<br>survey."
,"I was on a space tour when I received<br>a message about a facility in this town<br>being worth a whopping 800G!"
,"There's just no stopping you, is there?"
,"I won't be surprised if your town reaches<br>the highest land value in the world!"
"#02710","Why, hello there! I'm just swinging by<br>to take photos of cozy houses for<br>a lifestyle magazine."
,"There's a house estimated at over<br>200 coziness in this town. That's<br>pretty neat!"
,"As I was having a little walk around,<br>I thought, man, this town is shaping<br>up nicely."
,"I'll be popping over again to check<br>on any new developments here!"
"#02711","Why, hello there! I'm just swinging by<br>to take photos of cozy houses for<br>a lifestyle magazine."
,"There's a house estimated at over<br>300 coziness in this town. I'd like<br>to live in a house like that!"
,"As I was having a little walk around,<br>I thought, man, this town is shaping<br>up nicely."
,"I'll be popping over again to check<br>on any new developments here!"
"#02712","Why, hello there! I'm just swinging by<br>to take photos of cozy houses for<br>a lifestyle magazine."
,"There's a house estimated at over<br>500 coziness in this town. If I had<br>a place like that, I'd never go out, heh!"
,"As I was having a little walk around,<br>I thought, man, this town is shaping<br>up nicely."
,"I'll be popping over again to check<br>on any new developments here!"
"#02713","Hey there!"
,"I work for TV. We're doing a feature about<br>popular shops."
,"The town is so new, yet you already have<br>a shop with pricing over 10G.<br>Now that's a success story to report on!"
,"After 48 hours of non-stop interviews,<br>I think I've got an idea of how you<br>managed that. You've got some potential!"
"#02714","Hey there!"
,"I work for TV. We're doing a feature about<br>popular shops."
,"I found out that you've got a shop<br>with product pricing over 20G.<br>That's pretty amazing! And newsworthy!"
,"After 48 hours of non-stop interviews,<br>I think I've got an idea of how you<br>managed that. You've got some potential!"
"#02715","Hey there!"
,"I work for TV. We're doing a feature about<br>popular shops."
,"So one of your shops reached a pricing of<br>30G? I couldn't believe it at first!"
,"After 48 hours of non-stop interviews,<br>I think I've got an idea of how you<br>managed that. You've got some potential!"
"#02716","Ranking up is locked right now."
,"To unlock it, you've got to<br>earn some trophies!"
"#02717","Heh heh heh! You got me!"
"#02718","There, I'll lend you my power!"
"#02719","Heh, this will do for today."
"#02720","Hi. I'm just a passing-by angel."
"#02721","Now, behold my angelic powers<br>at work!"
"#02722","Whew! Pretty amazing, huh?<br>I'll be going now, see you!"
"#02723","It's me, Mochipon. Middle-aged<br>but young at heart!"
"#02724","Thanks for helping out an old man."
"#02725","Good, good. Come again!"
"#02726","They can't get a job yet."
,"Got to wait for them to grow up."
"#02727","Have you been good, working on<br>getting a high score for the last year?"
,"I have wonderful rewards for high scores,<br>but did you qualify?"
,"Let's check the results, shall we!"
"#02728","Good luck next year!"
"#02729","Hey, well done completing<br>the challenge!"
,"Here's the reward you earned!<br>See you around!"
"#02730","The deadline for the challenge<br>was <0>/<1>..."
,"Don't worry too much about it<br>and try again!"
"#02731","Good day! Would you like to hold<br>an event in your town? Pick one<br>and I'll take care of all the prep!"
"#02732","All right, that's booked then!<br>The event effects last about<br>two months."
"#02733","Oops! Looks like we're not ready<br>to invite tourists yet!"
,"We need to make this place accessible.<br>We could build a subway, for example."
"#02734","We got a bonus reward for fulfilling<br>someone's dreams."
"#02735","You've got a lot of diamonds.<br>Spend some before buying more."
"#02736","We'll be offering this lot for new<br>residents to build a house on."
,"It's a bit different from other things<br>that can be built but you place it<br>in the same way."
,"Pick a location for it, minding<br>the land value and coziness."
"#02737","Well done, I think you've chosen<br>a pretty good location."
,"Now we wait for someone interested<br>in moving in to show up."
,"If anything comes up, tap the facility."
"#02738","Offices are very important, as this is where<br>our residents will be making money."
,"It's best to place them in busy areas."
"#02739","Oh, by the way, this facility is a little special.<br>You may notice that no matter how much<br>time passes, construction just doesn't end."
,"That's because it requires a proximity<br>to nature to get finished."
,"Which means you'll need to have things like<br>trees and flowers around it."
"#02740","Oh, by the way, this facility is a little special.<br>You may notice that no matter how much<br>time passes, construction just doesn't end."
,"That's because it requires a proximity to<br>residential housing to get finished."
,"So place it close to houses."
"#02741","Oh, by the way, this facility is a little special.<br>You may notice that no matter how much<br>time passes, construction just doesn't end."
,"That's because it requires a proximity to<br>shops to get finished."
,"So place it close to shops."
"#02742","We've got a student in town!"
,"There are a few things you need to know<br>about students. They get discounts in shops and cannot get jobs."
,"But something neat may happen if you<br>have schools or other training facilities<br>where they live."
"#02743","We've got an elderly resident now!"
,"The thing about the elderly is that they<br>walk slower than younger people."
,"So keep that in mind when planning your<br>town to make sure they won't be<br>inconvenienced."
"#02744","Ho ho, greetings."
,"As you can likely tell, I'm a king, and I have<br>vast riches at my disposal... So I financially<br>support promising town developers."
,"My subjects have notified me that you're<br>showing great potential. I'll be thinking of<br>your little town while I bath every evening."
,"I have all these trophies for those who<br>fulfill the requirements. Have a look<br>and try to earn some!"
"#02745","It's a remarkable town you've built here."
,"Maybe you'd be interested in trying<br>some challenges? Completing them<br>can further stimulate your town's growth."
,"If you're up for it, access challenges<br>from the Action Menu."
"#02746","To think this used to be pretty much all<br>empty land when we started!"
,"And now it's a bustling urban area!<br>Our efforts are really paying off."
,"But there are towns nearby that<br>could use our help."
,"Won't you go and check them out?<br>Select Next Town from<br>the menu to do that."
"#02747","Users from all over the place cooperate<br>in helping the Next Towns."
,"Lend a hand with developing<br>a Next Town once you<br>collect some Tour Vouchers."
,"One more thing. I only work in this town,<br>so a different, but very capable, secretary<br>will assist you in other towns."
"#02748","Pleased to meet you. I'm Sheepy,<br>and I'll be your secretary while<br>you're outside your town."
,"First, choose whether you'd like to<br>found a town or help out with<br>developing one."
,"Pick whichever you like."
"#02749","Welcome!"
,"I offer a wide range of products that<br>you should find useful, from facilities<br>for construction to items."
,"Take a good look at my wares and<br>feel free to touch them if you wish."
,"How about this one, for example?"
"#02751","We've discovered a new facility!"
,"How about building it now?"
"#02752","Hello. I'm just an angel, what with<br>the wings and all."
,"I'll try to be of help."
"#02753","Wow, pinch me! We've been visited<br>by an angel!"
,"There's a rumor that something<br>nice may happen once a month, at night,<br>when an angel is around!"
"#02754","Hi! I'll be around. See you!"
"#02755","Oh my, a little angel, in our town!"
,"I heard that they do something<br>a little special once a month.<br>Well, we'll see!"
"#02756","Thank you for inviting me over!<br>What a lovely town. It's a pleasure<br>to be here."
,"I just love this place so much that<br>I went on a major shopping spree.<br>How will I carry all this stuff home?"
,"Anyway... We'll see each other again,<br>I'm sure."
"#02757","Err... This guy looks like trouble, if<br>you ask me."
,"Fingers crossed nothing bad happens..."
"#02758","Good to see you! You can find daily<br>challenges here."
,"Complete challenges for terrific rewards!<br>I assure you it's worth the effort!"
,"Don't be shy, give the missions<br>a try! I can't wait to give out all these<br>rewards."
"#02759","Welcome, come on in."
,"Did you know that making items<br>may raise residents' stats?<br>Well, now you do!"
,"Please take a look at my wares."
"#02760","All sorts of handy items are stored here."
,"There are three types:<br>- items you can use any time<br>- items usable on residents<br>- items equippable to buildings"
,"They all have cool effects, so make<br>good use of them!"
"#02761","Most facilities can be built in this<br>town for free."
"#02762","Looks like we'll be getting visitors!"
"#02763","There's no way for visitors to arrive."
,"We need to build a subway or something!"
"#02764","Friend info will be updated. It's good<br>to do it every once in a while."
"#02765","Select residents to invite over. It may<br>be a good idea to pick ones with lots<br>of savings or a high rank."
"#02766","Select this when you want to return<br>to your own town. Try to do it after<br>the visitors have left."
"#02767","If you succeed, you'll earn a spectacular<br>reward."
"#02768","Welcome! Here you can exchange your<br>Research Points for fabulous items."
"#02769","Ho ho ho! You've earned some trophies!"
"#02770","You're out of Tour Vouchers.<br>Collect more back at your town."
"#02771","Build lots of different facilities<br>and see if you can earn some rewards."
"#02772","You've cleared the second requirement!"
,"Collect more Tour Vouchers to earn<br>more Town Points!"
"#02773","Now just the last requirement!"
,"Only your individual achievements<br>will count towards this one.<br>But don't let that put you off trying!"
"#02774","You can now try the rank up challenge!"
,"Tap the <co=168fe5>CHALLENGE</co> icon!"
"#02775","Boss, a resident has started a <co=168fe5>makeover</co> on their house."
,"Residents who have lots of savings and<br>live in a very cozy place are more likely<br>to do a makeover."
,"It's nice that they want to make their<br>houses nicer, don't you think?"
"#02776","Boss, a <co=168fe5>new type of ride</co> has been spotted!"
,"Some residents may take interest and start<br>using it."
"#02777","Boss, a <co=168fe5>new type of ride</co> has been spotted!"
,"This one can be used on expressways.<br>Having the right kind of roads for<br>transportation is really important."
"#02778","Boss, a <co=168fe5>new type of pet</co> has been found!"
,"Pets have a positive effect on their<br>owners' stats. Plus, a town with<br>lots of critters around is more fun!"
"#02779","Residents started hanging out at the park.<br>They'll get to socialize there too."
,"Maybe they'll make new friends and<br>then...something nice may happen!"
"#02780","The office building is now in use."
,"Residents who approach an office<br>can go inside to do some work<br>and earn a salary."
,"That's why it's best when offices are<br>located where lots of people pass by."
"#02781","Oh, looks like there's someone who has<br>already visited all the shops in their area."
,"Residents only visit each kind of shop<br>once a month."
,"You may want to build more shops<br>near the residential areas."
"#02782","Oh, looks like there's someone with<br>no office near their house."
,"They won't be able to earn their monthly<br>salary without an office nearby."
"#02783","The special thing about this area<br>is the subway!"
,"If you build shops near the subway,<br>tourists may sometimes drop in!"
,"But first things first. We need to clear<br>the requirements to access this area."
"#02784","Facilities of this type are meant<br>for students."
,"That doesn't sound very good?<br>Just wait until you have plenty<br>of students around and you'll see!"
"#02785","Boss, we've got someone who<br>wants to change their career."
,"A new job can mean higher stats<br>and salary, so let's give them a chance!"
"#02786","Boss!"
,"One of our residents looks very fidgety."
,"Let's see what's up!"
"#02787","Boss! One of our resident's dreams<br>have come true!"
"#02788","Oh, so it wasn't just a rumor...<br>One of the town resident's wants to<br>participate in a contest."
,"Let's talk to them!"
"#02789","Good of you to come here. So you<br>want to acquire more land? Very well,<br>if you can pass my test!"
,"I give you <0> months.<br>You must earn over <2> <1><br>within this new area."
,"If you fail to do it, you can't keep it!"
,"As you can probably guess, building<br>many shops in this new area is key.<br>Let's see how you do."
"#02790","You didn't meet the requirements<br>to keep this area."
,"I'm taking it back, as agreed."
,"Feel free to try again later."
"#02791","Let's see if you cleared the requirements<br>for this area..."
,"It looks like you'll get to keep this area!"
,"Good job passing the test. It wasn't easy.<br>Now you can manage this area however<br>you like."
"#02792","The deadline for the land acquisition<br>test is coming up."
,"If we don't meet the requirements,<br>we will also lose all the facilities<br>built within the trial area..."
,"There's not much time left<br>so let's step on it and make<br>sure we pass!"
"#02793","I was so impressed that on top of handing<br>over this area to you, I'll give you this<br>facility as well, at no extra cost."
"#02794","The weekly event map is now closed."
,"Join again next time!"
"#02795","A new weekly event map is now open."
,"Join the event, it's really fun!"
"#02796","Boss!"
,"We've got our very first tourist!<br>What a great day for <town>!"
,"Tourists wander around the town<br>as long as they have money."
,"It seems that having popular facilities<br>near the subway can attract more<br>tourists. Worth trying, huh?"
,"The more tourists spending money<br>in our town, the better!"
"#02797","You're already hungry for more land?<br>I wasn't expecting you to be expanding<br>your town this fast..."
,"You're making progress at an alarming rate!"
,"I feel like I should do something to support<br>an ambitious town developer such as you...<br>Here, take this."
"#02798","That was a nice surprise, getting all<br>that stuff!"
,"Let's start building facilities in the new<br>area and pass the test to get it!"
,"The easiest way to do it is to build<br>lots of high-pricing facilities and<br>residential houses."
,"...Only, we don't have many<br>facilities available. We'll have to<br>be smart about placing them!"
"#02799","Howdy! I have learned through unofficial<br>channels that you're worried about<br>having too few types of facilities."
,"Incidentally, I've just opened my SHOP.<br>Please do pop in when you have time."
,"No promises, but you may discover new<br>facilities when you shop at my place.<br>See you soon, I hope!"
"#02800","All right, so you're up for the rank up<br>challenge?"
,"In that case...prepare for battle!<br>That's right, it's town versus town!"
,"Your battle power is decided based on<br>land value and pricing of your facilities."
,"Your 5 best facilities will be chosen<br>and faced off against those of<br>your opponent!"
,"May the battle begin!"
"#02801","Congratulations!<br><town> has won the battle!"
"#02802","<town> has been defeated.<br>Better luck next time!"
"#02803","Woops! As you can see, when facilities<br>get defeated in battle, they temporarily<br>close for business."
,"Once you're back on the town map,<br>you'll notice it takes some time for<br>them to recover from the damage."
,"You should raise the land value,<br>as it makes facilities more durable<br>in battle!"
"#02804","The cost varies depending on land value."
,"For now, just pick a location facing a road."
"#02805","That's a good spot for it."
,"Now <co=168fe5>close the Build screen</co>."
"#02807","Welcome back! Ah, you're out of<br>Tour Vouchers..."
"#02808","Weekly ranking results are announced today.<br>Let's see how we're doing compared to<br>your friends."
"#02809","It's too late to get rewards for the last<br>weekly ranking now."
,"Make sure to check the game within the week<br>after registering for the rankings."
"#02810","This facility is kind of neat. It will<br>very occasionally sell rides when<br>residents use it."
,"But gradually, we'll get lots of vehicles<br>in the town thanks to it!"
"#02811","I think...I think I'm not just a kid anymore!<br>I'm a proper grown-up now."
,"And I'm ready to find a job. No more<br>sponging off mom and dad, heh!"
"#02812","Aw, shucks. We didn't make it this time."
,"Don't despair over it! Next time try using<br>items, or raise residents' stats by giving<br>them new jobs."
"#02814","Oh no, it looks like you don't have enough<br>Tour Vouchers. Collect more in your own town."
"#02815","We've got an entrance point on the map.<br>You can call visitors using Tour Vouchers<br>and they'll appear at the entrance point."
"#02816","Boss, there's a shop with a Bonus status!"
,"Having Bonus shops next to other shops<br>has a really good effect! You'll see!"
"#02817","Umm... I checked how many Kairo Points<br>we had and it's nothing to write home about."
,"It's true that they're hard to get. Maybe<br>you could try logging in every day?"
,"I also heard you can earn them from<br>Next Town maps."
,"Ah, and actually, Kairobot gave me some<br>points for you earlier. Here."
"#02818","Facilities need road access or they<br>won't be used."
,"<co=168fe5>Rotate</co> the facility so that it faces<br>the road."
"#02819","Boss, you're so good at picking the right<br>locations for facilities!"
"#02820","We've got a great combo going there!<br>Things are looking good for our town."
"#02821","Hey there!"
,"I was so engrossed in the game I was<br>playing that I didn't notice when<br>I dropped a briefcase with my money..."
,"I don't have time to look for it, though.<br>So if you find it, feel free to use it<br>for town development."
,"I'll be off now. Need to announce a new<br>game at a conference abroad. Bye!"
"#02822","Oh umm... Actually, I found a<br>briefcase with that person's picture<br>on it..."
,"Since we have permission to keep it...<br>Let's put it to good use!"
"#02823","Hey there!"
,"I took the first flight here when I heard<br>a new game was about to be released,<br>but it seems it got delayed to next month."
,"I brought a lot of money to buy the rights<br>to the IP, but I no longer need it so...<br>It's yours, if you want."
"#02824","I'm off to another country to collect<br>monsters in a certain location-based<br>game. Gotta get every one. Bye!"
"#02826","It's a fun job. Try it if you ever feel like<br>you need a break from all this town<br>building!"
,"Gotta zoom off now. See you!"
"#02827","Hi! I'm on the way to my next race,<br>but I stopped by as it seems you're<br>having some trouble and I can help."
,"You don't have many diamonds, do you?"
,"I've got all these diamonds working<br>as pilot for hire, and have no use<br>for them. Here, take some."
"#02828","If you ever get tired of town building,<br>try putting together a fearless pilot<br>team!"
,"Gotta zoom off now. See you!"
"#02830","Maybe you'd like to try running a cakery<br>yourself some day? It's very enjoyable!"
,"Bye!"
"#02831","Hi! Seems like you're a little low on<br>Service Pts, right?"
,"I've had the exact same problem, you can<br>believe me! I work in the apparel industry.<br>Well, just retail, to be precise."
,"While I was a shop manager, I found out<br>that the more retail shops you have,<br>the more Service Pts you get."
,"Here, have some of my points, to help<br>you get back on the right track."
"#02832","Try managing a fashion store some day<br>for a change!"
,"Bye!"
"#02833","Hi! Don't have all that many<br>Amusement Pts, do you?"
,"Don't worry, it's a very common problem.<br>In fact, it's been featured in a magazine<br>for secretaries recently!"
,"As I was working as a station manager's<br>secretary, I discovered that you simply<br>need lots of amusement-type facilities."
,"I've got some Amusement Pts I can<br>share with you. There you go."
"#02834","You should give station managing a go<br>too, you might like it!"
,"Bye!"
"#02835","Hi! Suffering from a deficit of Culture Pts,<br>I hear?"
,"You're not the only one!"
,"According to my research, you can generate<br>these points by building more<br>education-type facilities."
,"All the researching I do left me with<br>surplus Culture Pts, so you can<br>have some."
"#02836","And another piece of advice. Bananas<br>are a great source of potassium. And<br>they taste good, too. Nom nom..."
,"Bye!"
"#02837","How many residents does the town<br>have? One, two, three..."
,"...ten! We have ten residents!<br>A nice, round number."
"#02841","Let me check in the database how<br>many residents we've got now..."
,"Is this correct? Someone pinch me!<br>Three hundred residents!"
,"Not to say that I didn't have faith in<br>this town, but I never expected<br><town> to get this big."
,"You've made this town a very attractive<br>place to live. Keep it up!"
"#02842","Good job finishing the challenge<br>the other day."
,"Challenges change daily, so make sure<br>to keep checking them."
,"And don't forget to get your bonus<br>diamonds!"
"#02843","By the way, a town event's effects<br>last for about two months."
,"Events can be held in March,<br>June, September and December<br>each year."
,"Make sure to stock up on points<br>before the event months!"
"#02845","Hello! I was watching the live broadcast<br>of the Real Estate Ranking Awards<br>last week..."
,"...and I saw that <town> ranked in<br>for the first time, and there was even<br>a short feature about it."
,"It sparked my interest in this town!<br>I'll be following news on it from now on."
,"I always cheer for the underdogs, so<br>I'd love to see you reach top rank one day!"
"#02846","Boss, I see we've got a new friend."
,"At the end of the year you can compare<br>your hi-score against those of friends.<br>There's a bonus for scoring higher!"
,"Having friends to compete against adds<br>a new dimension of fun to town building."
"#02847","You impressed me with how you handled<br>developing the next town over!"
,"You are a real virtuoso! The town<br>attracted so many visitors, it was<br>splendidly designed!"
,"The next town events are once<br>a week. I hope you'll keep taking<br>part in them!"
"#02848","Thank you so much for removing that<br>nasty obstacle!"
,"I was taking a nap when it dropped down<br>from the sky and I found myself trapped."
,"Now that you've freed me, I'll go<br>and look for something nice to eat."
,"See you again some time, maybe!"
"#02849","Your facilities are <co=168fe5>leveling up</co> nicely, I see!"
,"I'm not sure if it's true, but I heard<br>people say that facilities level up<br>when they get used a lot."
,"So it may be good to place them<br>in busy locations. Anyway, see<br>if you can get them all to max level!"
,"Bye!"
"#02850","A resident's job level has increased to 2!"
,"As residents keep working at their offices,<br>they become more experienced at their<br>jobs, and eventually level up."
,"Which means, we've got to make sure<br>they have an office to go to within<br>their range."
"#02852","Boss, a resident got a <co=168fe5>treasure chest</co><br>from a shop!"
,"Shops give them out to residents<br>who fulfill certain requirements."
,"Have residents visits lots of different<br>shops so they can collect more treasure,<br>and then something cool might happen!"
"#02853","Residents have been collecting a fair<br>amount of treasure."
,"But did you know the odds of getting<br>it depends on their stats?"
,"Try raising their stats either through job<br>changes or by using items!"
"#02854","Boss, it looks like all dreams have<br>come true for one of our residents!"
,"It's so heartwarming to think<br>we made someone this happy."
,"Let's see if we can fulfill the dreams<br>of more people!"
"#02855","There are items which have amazing<br>effects on facilities or residents."
,"If you find any, don't let them sit in<br>your inventory gathering dust, but<br>make use of them!"
"#02856","We've reached the maximum<br>possible number of residents<br>for a town of this rank."
"#02857","Unfortunately, my staff in charge<br>of this area is off today, so I cannot<br>do the handover today."
"#02858","Our resident won the contest<br>in such style!"
,"Let's keep working on raising<br>the residents' stats so they can<br>win lots of contests!"
"#02859","It's great to see our residents<br>winning contests."
,"Let's help more of them improve<br>their stats so they can become<br>winners too!"
"#02860","Hmm? You're in need of some<br>Tour Vouchers?"
,"I should have some... Which pocket<br>was it... Ah, here!"
,"Oops, that was my hankie, sorry!"
,"There they are! You can have them."
"#02861","See you later in the next town!"
"#02862","Welcome back... It's such a pity<br>we lost the battle."
,"The facilities which were forced<br>to close down need some time to<br>recover, so let's wait before trying again."
,"We should raise the land value<br>and pricing of our shops to stand<br>a better chance."
"#02863","Aw, that was just too bad!"
,"We've got to raise the land value<br>and pricing of our shops."
,"There are items which can be equipped<br>to facilities that do just that...<br>Like this one!"
"#02864","Good day! My company organizes<br>events designed to stimulate<br>town development."
,"There is a small fee, but I can promise you<br>that you get very good value for your money."
,"They say first impressions matter,<br>so I brought you a gift this time.<br>Good PR and all that. Hope you like it."
"#02865","I'll come by later to discuss the details."
,"Got to be on my way. Goodbye!"
"#02866","Hi, hope you're doing great.<br>My boss sent me here to deliver<br>this to you."
,"It should be of some use. Please<br>visit the SHOP when you have time.<br>See you there!"
"#02867","Bye!"
"#02868","Greetings. I was in the area,<br>so I stopped by to see how you<br>were doing."
,"The town is looking great, it's really<br>come a long way. I keep beating myself<br>up over not being able to contribute..."
,"Although I guess I can at least<br>give you this."
"#02869","Keep up the good work! See you!"
"#02870","How terrific of you to have acquired<br>a new area for your town!"
,"To mark this big step forward<br>for the town, I've prepared a little<br>comedy performance and a gift..."
,"First, here's the gift."
"#02871","And now for the performance...<br>I...ouch! Oh, that hurts..."
,"I really wanted to back your projects..."
,"But how can I do it with a bad back?<br>...That's it. I err...I'll go now."
"#02872","We're currently at the max rank."
,"But there is a way to increase the max<br>rank cap. We'd need to buy a bulldozer..."
,"Why don't you check out the SHOP?"
"#02873","What a victory!"
,"We got some prizes!"
"#02874","Hey there!"
,"I'm so happy to be living in a great<br>town like this that I may short-circuit<br>from an overload of joy."
,"Set your goals high and make it<br>the best town in the world!"
"#02875","Hello, why, I'm sure you're charmed<br>to make my acquaintance."
,"It's my first visit here so I brought<br>you a golden cake... Oh, apologies!<br>I've already eaten it."
,"No matter. I'm sure you will be<br>thrilled enough to have me move<br>into your town."
"#02876","Heh heh heh..."
,"Not bad, making a town even<br>I want to live in."
,"Let's see how it goes from now on.<br>Heh heh..."
"#02877","Hey there!"
,"All my friends have been raving about<br>this town, saying it's absolutely fabulous,<br>so I had to come and see it for myself."
,"What I'm most interested in is food...<br>I'll thoroughly investigate the quality<br>of your restaurants, hehehe!"
,"Can't wait to dig in!"
"#02878","Oh my!"
,"You've noticed me? How nice."
,"I'm just having a walk around to see<br>the local sights. It's such a pretty town."
"#02879","Having a beary good day, I trust?"
,"The lights and sounds and smells of<br>the city lured me out of the forest.<br>It's not a bad place to live."
,"I'll find myself a cubby-hole to move into<br>and spend the days thinking up ways<br>to further improve your town."
,"Well, I look forward to getting settled<br>in around here!"
"#02880","Hello. I'm Ackbar, owner of the vastest<br>oil fields in the world."
,"I've heard some people call me<br>""Acky."" And I just wanted to say..."
,"...DON'T YOU DARE CALL ME ACKY.<br>I'm king Ackbar, thank you very much."
"#02881","What's up?"
,"So, you got any good restaurants<br>over here?"
,"My goal in life is to eat as much as I can<br>and I'm serious about achieving it."
,"Hope you don't mind a grizzly old bear<br>among your residents."
"#02882","Squeak!"
,"D-don't pet me so much...<br>It's embarrassing! STAHP!"
,"I-I've got places to be...<br>Skippity skip!"
"#02883","Hello, how are you!"
,"Teacher said to always greet everyone<br>politely and to speak clearly.<br>Sorry if I'm too loud, though!"
,"I'm very happy to be living in this<br>town! Bye-bye!"
"#02884","What lovely weather we're having."
,"How perfect for a picnic in an iconic<br>city park, with some delightful cake<br>and hot drink in a thermos flask."
,"I hope you will have a lovely day,<br>my friend."
"#02885","How goes it?"
,"I'm here just for a quick look-over.<br>What it's about? Can't tell you,<br>it's confidential, heh heh."
,"I'll be seeing you around."
"#02886","Hi. I used to be a film director.<br>You must have heard about me?"
,"No, it's true. I made several films.<br>Maybe I should make a documentary<br>about this town, what do you think?"
,"Hope you don't mind a grizzly old bear<br>among your residents."
"#02887","Bananas!"
,"Oh, I was just talking to myself. Hello."
,"I set out on a quest to find banana trees,<br>accidentally entered a triathlon and<br>won it, somehow."
,"The first prize was a house in this town,<br>so I'll be living here now, I guess.<br>The world's gone bananas!"
"#02888","Hello, how are you?"
,"I've been looking for a new town<br>to set up shop in."
,"Here's good. I'll make this town my<br>new base of operations and sell<br>my wares in other games."
"#02889","Curse thee!"
,"O-oh, sorry, I mistook you for someone<br>else. It's umm, a nice day, huh?"
,"Sorry if I spooked you. See you!"
"#02890","Good evening!"
,"Wait, is it evening? I'm an astronaut<br>and all that traveling through dark<br>space makes me think it's always night."
,"It's nice to spend some time on Earth<br>every now and then."
,"Hope you don't mind a grizzly old bear<br>among your residents."
"#02891","Hi! I was on a walk nearby and decided<br>to check this town out."
,"I've been looking for a new place to<br>settle in since I retired."
,"I have to say, I like it here! This town<br>is just buzzing with potential.<br>I'm staying!"
"#02892","Yaaaawn! Is it morning already?"
,"I was up all night and didn't get<br>much sleep..."
,"Maybe now that I'm living here<br>I can finally fix my sleep cycle."
"#02894","Let me snap a few photos... Excellent."
,"I'm going to upload these to every single<br>social media site. Hey, why don't you<br>do that too?"
,"You can find me in town any time.<br>I could take some cool photos for<br>you to share with the world."
"#02895","Hiya!"
,"Something tells me that your town<br>holds a huge secret! That's why<br>I've come here."
,"Although to be honest, my gut feeling<br>has never been right so far. I'll have to<br>work on honing my intuition..."
"#02896","Eeeeeooooeeeoooeeeoooo!"
,"Sup! I'm a firefighter."
,"Got a fire to put out? No?<br>Should I start one?<br>Haha, just joking!"
,"I'll be living in this town from today.<br>You don't have to worry about fires<br>anymore!"
"#02897","So like, this place is sick!<br>No, I mean in a good way, sheesh!"
,"It's got like, a really chilled out feel."
,"So I'm gonna stick around, I guess?"
,"Gotta move all my stuff to the new house...<br>See ya!"
"#02898","Zzz..."
,"Mngh... Zzz..."
,"Zzz... Oh, hello. I found a house that's<br>perfect for naps. I'm taking it."
,"This town's my new home!"
"#02899","Haaaa! Take that! And this!<br>Yaaaah!"
,"I'm a traveling hero of justice.<br>Any baddies giving you trouble<br>around here?"
,"No? Really?"
