"#00724","In this simulation game, you run a ninja village in feudal Japan. Develop your secret ninja village as you fight to help the shogunate unify the country."
,"▼Game Flow<br>Earn money by having your villagers make goods to sell to visiting travellers. Defeat warlords or use items to acquire new territory and expand your village."
,"▼Unify Japan<br>As the game advances, your villagers will be able to join the shogun's forces in battle. Send them to fight regional warlords and help unify Japan under the shogunate."
,"▼Increasing Villagers<br>Local lords join your village if you defeat them in battle. Defeating warlords can reveal other potential villagers who will join you if the price is right."
,"▼Training Villagers<br>You can spend money to strengthen your villagers through training, raising their levels and making battles easier to win. Some may also learn new skills."
,"▼Travellers<br>You can earn money by selling travellers food from your fields or goods from your shops. New visitors may appear whenever you defeat a warlord."
,"▼Shops and Goods<br>Workshops produce goods from raw materials transported there, and those goods are then sold in nearby shops. The closer a workshop is to the source of materials, the more efficient its production."
,"▼Materials 1<br>Raw materials for producing goods are acquired from fields, trees, and mines. Trees and mines can be removed and set up in new locations, so try to place them near workshops."
,"▼Materials 2<br>Travellers will also purchase raw materials from you directly. You can disable this via the menu when you want to conserve materials for production."
,"▼Improving the Environment<br>Things like cherry trees and flower gardens have a positive effect on their surroundings. They can enhance a home's healing effects, boost a workshop or field's productivity, or increase a shop's sales."
,"▼Battles 1<br>Your villagers fight alongside the shogun's gunners, archers, infantry, and cavalry. Each battle lasts up to three rounds."
,"▼Battles 2<br>Villagers selected for  battle are automatically assigned to units based on their equipment. For example, a villager must have a melee weapon and a mount to be assigned to the cavalry."
,"▼Battle Formation<br>Villagers can be assigned to front, center, or rear battle ranks. Plan your formations strategically to gain an edge in battle."
,"▼Warlord Development<br>Whenever you defeat a warlord, those remaining grow stronger, so it's vital to plot your order of attack carefully. Some warlords can develop very swiftly indeed..."
,"▼Skills<br>Defeating warlords can bring you new technology. Acquiring sword technology, for instance, allows you to research new kinds of swords."
,"▼Villager Attributes 1<br><co=0066cc>HP</co>: Character retreats if HP is reduced to 0.<br><co=0066cc>Strength</co>: Affects attack power with swords and spears.<br><co=0066cc>Marksmanship</co>: Affects attack power with bows and firearms."
,"▼Villager Attributes 2<br><co=0066cc>Work</co>: Stronger work ethic means faster work and walking pace in the village.<br><co=0066cc>Skills</co>: These give advantages when invoked, whether in battle or daily life."
,"▼Villager Attributes 3<br><co=0066cc>Attack</co>: Affects damage inflicted on foes.<br><co=0066cc>Defense</co>: Affects damage taken from enemy attacks."
,"▼Combat Skills<br>Some skills, like Strategy or Arrow Resist, affect all members of a character's unit. The effect vanishes if that character is defeated."
,"▼Special Equipment<br>Villagers can equip a variety of special items, such as mounts to ride into battle and herbs to heal wounds automatically during combat. Many other valuable types are rumored to be out there as well."
,"▼Ending<br>The game ""ends"" at the end of March in the 16th game year. Your score is based on funds and points earned by the end. You can keep playing as long as you like afterward."
,"▼Other<br>At the end of the game, some attributes can be transferred over to your next playthrough."

"#00725","Mrk"
"#00726","   Greetings, and welcome to the first issue of the Ninja News--a publication by ninjas, for ninjas. We risk our lives to bring you all the latest news, so we hope you'll make use of it!<br>   It seems that a newcomer known as the <fname> clan has arisen to challenge the local lords warring for control of <name>. They, too, evidently seek to unify the area under their rule. We look forward to seeing how they fare in this ongoing struggle.<br>   We'll continue to bring you updates as they come in, so stay tuned."
"#00727","   Greetings, friends. We're here to bring you information on <name>, so without further ado...<br>   A new village has appeared in <name> for a total of four in the area. Local lords have been discussing how to handle the situation and have apparently adopted a ""wait and see"" approach for now.<br>   We'll continue to deliver details as they come in, so don't miss out!"
"#00728","     Big news from <name>! According to our sources, the <fname> clan has defeated both the Nishizawa and Shakujii clans and now rivals the Asaryu clan in power. A decisive contest could well be coming soon. Local residents would be well advised to clear out of the vicinity."
"#00729","   <name> has been rocked by changes recently, but it seems the turmoil is finally over. The <fname> clan has decisively defeated the Asaryu clan and unified <name>!<br>   Now that the fighting is over at last, expect to see more travellers visiting the area. Residents would do well to spruce it up with shops, workshops, and other amenities to keep visitors coming!"
"#00730","   Momentous news! The long-reigning shogun has been driven from the capital!<br>   The shogunate's downfall is sure to ignite a struggle for power amongst the country's warlords.<br>   Incidentally, the shogun's whereabouts are currently unknown..."
"#00731","   A shortage of goods has become painfully apparent in <0>. Such shortages are commonly caused by delays in production.<br>   One possible solution is to switch to goods that require fewer raw materials. If you have villagers with a particularly strong <co=0000ff>work</co> ethic, building them houses near workshops can also help."
"#00732","   Greetings. We hope this issue finds you in good health.<br>   Today we'd like to recount a battle we witnessed recently. A certain commander ordered her archers to fire at the enemy cavalry. Their arrows soared high overhead to rain destruction down on the horsemen, wiping out the entire unit.<br>   As they fell, every man seemed astonished at being defeated before he'd even had a chance to fight.<br>   Remember, using your archers flexibly and effectively can be the key to victory."
"#00733","   Greetings. The other day, your humble reporter infiltrated Kanayama, part of the Takeda clan's domain. I slipped past heavy security and saw an impressive sight indeed: they were moving and rearranging <co=0066cc>mines</co> however they pleased!<br>   It makes sense, of course, that it's easier to work mines when they're located in heavily populated areas, but I never imagined that it was possible to relocate the mines themselves...<br>   I hope this information proves useful. In the meantime, I'll be converting some ore into cash, then taking a long vacation. Until next time."
"#00734","   Greetings. This missive comes to you from the secret dig site of some buried gold. On that note, allow me to share a tip on making money, something on the mind of every village leader.<br>   It's obvious, really: if you have villagers with a strong <co=0000ff>work</co> ethic, build them houses near workshops and fields. The stronger their work ethic, the harder they work and the faster they walk.<br>   If you spot someone who seems to have too much free time, try instilling a better work ethic through training."
"#00735","   Earthshaking news! The shogunate has reclaimed control of the country! Farewell to days of ruin and strife. The land belongs to the Ashikaga clan once more.<br>   People are whispering that Lord Ashikaga actually had little to do with this tremendous feat and that a certain band of ninjas deserves the lion's share of the credit. Alas, their contribution will likely be lost to the mists of history...<br>   Just remember this, friends: The true battle still lies ahead."
"#00736","   In a recent interview, an architect renowned for designing entire castle towns revealed that cherry trees and flower beds can impart positive effects on buildings nearby.<br>   For houses, they can help occupants recover energy more quickly. For fields and workshops, they can boost production. And in the case of shops, they can affect prices or influence customers to buy more. Give it a try!"

"#00889","Greetings, my lord! It is my privilege to serve as advisor to the <fname> clan."
,"Here in <name>, there are several settlements scattered about competing for territory."
,"The <fname> clan's holdings may yet be humble, but we'll change that soon enough!"
,"If you ever have any questions, try selecting ""Tutorial"" from the ""System"" menu."
,"First, let's build a house for the villager who accompanied you here. Select ""<co=3366ff>Build</co>"" from the menu."
"#00890","Well done. <1> years have now passed. This chapter of the game ends here."
,"Your Clear Points will now be calculated."
"#00891","Your Clear Points come to: <1>."
,"Congratulations! You got a new high score!"
,"See if you can beat it on your next playthrough!"
"#00892","Your Clear Points come to: <1>."
,"Aw, you didn't beat your high score."
,"See if you can beat it on your next playthrough!"
"#00893","Your high score won't change from this point on."
,"But you're welcome to keep playing for as long as you like."
"#00894","First, select ""Farmhouse"" from the ""Enviro"" menu."
"#00895","It looks like we're running low on funds..."
,"It just so happens that I saved a bit of money for just such an occasion..."
,"But this is all we have, so please watch your spending!"
"#00896","A welcome offer indeed! Why not sell some of the <co=3366ff>food</co> from our fields?"
"#00897","Very well, I'll buy<co=3366ff> <0></co> units of food for <co=3366ff><1></co>."
,"I'll be stopping in now and then, so I hope you'll consider expanding your fields."
"#00898","Welcome to Pumpkin Products! What can I get you?"
"#00899","Thank you. See you again."
"#00900","Thank you. Can I get you anything else?"
"#00901","Lord <fname>, the shogun's army has arrived!"
"#00902","Well, then, we're off to the battlefield!"
"#00903","It seems that everyone has been stricken with sudden stomachaches... I'll inform the shogun at once."
"#00904","Yes! A new house! My feet are swollen from standing around out here so long..."
,"I'll start working any fields nearby once I've rested up."
"#00905","Wow! It seems someone's staying on top of developments here in <name>!"
,"This could prove useful in the future, so let's keep our eyes and ears open."
"#00906","Lord <fname>... I sent an operative to the <co=3366ff>Iroha district</co> to gather intelligence."
,"It seems the mission was a success. Let's see what our agent discovered."
"#00907","Hello. I'm <co=3366ff><0></co>!"
,"I've returned with information that could help take the Iroha district. I hope it proves useful."
"#00908","I hope to be of service in the future, Lord <fname>!"
"#00909","All right, on to <co=3366ff><0></co>! Let's take it quickly!"
"#00910","Hey! I didn't think you'd be fighting for real!"
,"Since you've taken my land, I guess you'll have to accept me into the <fname> clan!"
"#00911","Oh, yeah. I have an interesting tidbit for you."
,"It's about the <co=3366ff>Hoheto district</co>! I dug up the info in hopes of using it one day, but..."
,"It's useless to me now, so I'll pass it on to you."
"#00912","Alas, my dream of ruling the land is over..."
,"I'm not happy about it, but I have to eat... So I'll serve the <fname> clan."
"#00913","Lord <fname>! We've caught a follower of the Nishizawa clan. He fled when the clan fell."
,"He has nowhere to go, so let's let him stay here."
"#00914","Congratulations! We're close to unifying <name> now."
,"But our next opponent is a formidable one. We may need to reevaluate our equipment."
,"On that note, there's someone I'd like to introduce!"
"#00915","Greetings! I represent Pumpkin Products."
,"We carry goods from across the country, so if you have need of anything, just say the word."
"#00916","I hope to see you soon. Farewell!"
"#00917","Looks like he's a ninja too... Select ""<co=3366ff>Merchant</co>"" from the menu when you want to summon him."
"#00918","Oh, we got something extra this time. Little touches like that do bring in customers! Let's see what it is..."
,"Wow, it's tactical info on the Asaryu clan!"
"#00919","We lost, unfortunately... Let's train our villagers and try again!"
,"To train someone, select ""<co=3366ff>Train</co>"" from the ""<co=3366ff>Villagers</co>"" menu."
"#00920","Well, well... I had no idea you'd come so far. I know when I'm beaten. I'll serve you well."
"#00921","Congratulations! <name> is now one under your rule!"
,"But our work is just beginning. We'll need to store up funds as well."
,"Fortunately, the Asaryu clan had a <co=0066cc>tea shop</co> and <co=0066cc>workshop</co> we can use. Try selecting them."
"#00922","With shops we can earn money by selling goods to travellers passing through."
,"Goods are produced by <co=3366ff>workshops</co> and brought to neighboring shops to be sold."
"#00923","Workshops produce goods from <co=0066cc>food</co> or other raw materials."
,"They decide what type of goods to produce based on what shops are in the area."
"#00924","What an incredible turn of events..."
,"Who knows what may happen next... We'd best keep close tabs on the situation around here."
"#00925","Lord <fname>! We have a very important visitor!"
"#00926","Greetings! I'm the shogun. I was driven from the capital recently."
,"I was at a loss for where to turn when I heard about <name>."
,"Let me get right to the point. Will you help me restore the shogunate to power?"
"#00927","Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
,"I'd like to build a castle nearby and organize an army."
,"I'm afraid I'm short on funds, however. Could you possibly contribute?"
,"I'm counting on you. Until we meet again!"
"#00928","Wow, I was so nervous... But this should be a great chance to demonstrate our power!"
,"Select ""<co=0066cc>Research</co>"" from the menu when you wish to contribute funds to the shogunate."
"#00929","Thank you! I'll set about organizing an army at once. It should be ready shortly."
"#00930","The shogunate has evidently set up a base."
,"Try opening the map by tapping the ""<co=0066cc>Map</co>"" soft key."
"#00931","Open the map to view info on the warlords' bases as well as our own."
,"To restore the shogunate, we'll have to subjugate the warlords into swearing fealty to me."
,"Speak freely if you have an opinion on which warlord we should attack."
,"Well, then. Let's work to unify the land!"
"#00932","Infantry advances on the enemy and engages their front line in close combat."
,"They also help shield the rear ranks, so always ensure there are enough infantry troops."
"#00933","Archers can shoot over the heads of enemy infantry to attack their rear lines."
,"While not suited to close combat, they're useful for thinning the enemy's rear ranks."
"#00934","Gunners are the first to move, attacking with powerful firearms."
,"While not suited to close combat, they can demolish infantry units with enough firepower."
"#00935","Cavalry are mounted warriors who strike from horseback. They charge last."
,"Enough cavalry can smash through enemy ranks instantly."
"#00936","We can recruit more people now. Select ""<co=0000ff>Recruit</co>"" from the ""<co=0000ff>Villagers</co>"" menu to do so."
"#00937","We found something on that land we just acquired: <co=0000ff><0></co>."
,"Build a <co=0000ff>lumber depot</co> nearby and your villagers will harvest <co=0000ff><1></co>."
,"If you remove the <0>, you can set it up again via the ""Build"" menu."
"#00938","We found something on that land we just acquired: <0>."
,"Build an <co=0000ff>ore depot</co> nearby and your villagers will mine <co=0000ff><1></co>."
"#00939","A shop has run out of stock... Set up fields or workshops to increase production!"
,"If we're running short of materials, another option is to halt sales to travellers for the time being."
,"Just go to ""<co=3366ff>Materials</co>"" under the ""<co=3366ff>Info</co>"" menu to toggle sales on or off."
"#00940","What a nice house! I'm sure it will motivate occupants to work even harder."
"#00941","There's a box of money in the area we just acquired. Select it to open it."
"#00942","The area <co=3366ff><0> </co>is now ripe for the taking!"
,"Select it to launch an attack."
"#00943","You can now move buildings and facilities! Select ""Move"" from the ""Build"" menu to do so."
"#00944","Well done! Here's <co=3366ff><0></co>G for your trouble."
"#00945","Lord <fname>! We've received complaints from a nearby village that some <co=3366ff><0></co> are causing trouble."
"#00946","<co=0000ff><0></co> research is now <1>% complete."
"#00947","All right, let's teach that <co=0000ff><0></co> a lesson! I'm counting on all of you!"
"#00948","Don't get sloppy just because this isn't the real thing! Let's give it our best!"
"#00949","Hello! So you're here to eliminate us, eh? We won't let that happen!"
"#00950","This is our turf! Leave now or face the consequences!"
"#00951","Travellers! Watch yourselves!"
"#00952","I'm afraid you must fall if the Satomi clan is to regain its former glory!"
"#00953","Prepare to meet our amphibious fury!"
"#00954","What do you want?! We were hibernating! Leave us alone!"
"#00955","More hunters? Allow us to demonstrate why we're called phantoms!"
"#00956","So you're our opponents? Let's all do our best to make this interesting!"
"#00957","You win! I'll do whatever you say!"
"#00958","I knew we shouldn't have defaulted on our rent... We'll serve you starting tomorrow!"
"#00959","Hmm... It is no ordinary man who can stop me. I am yours for life!"
"#00960","I'll forget about rebuilding the Satomi clan! I answer to you now, master!"
"#00961","Aggh! My skin is drying out! Do something!"
"#00962","I guess a little light exercise really is the best way to wake up. Thanks for your help."
,"I'll be happy to return the favor if you wish!"
"#00963","My stomach's been upset all day! I'm usually much tougher than this!"
,"Well, I suppose I can join you if you insist."
"#00964","You've got some nice things... Join me and the world shall be ours!"
"#00965","Greetings. I've come on the emperor's business."
,"His Imperial Majesty is most grieved by the unrest that afflicts our land."
,"He has decided to assist the restoration of the shogunate by opening a <co=0066cc>training ground</co>!"
"#00966","Select the training ground to fight mock battles with imperial troops."
,"Prevail and you'll be rewarded, so we encourage you to take advantage of it. Farewell!"
"#00967","It seems we lost. Here is your reward, as promised."
"#00968","It seems the victory is ours. I look forward to our next meeting!"
"#00969","We'll bring even stronger warriors next time!"
"#00970","My lord! The enemy is here. Leave them to me."
"#00971","I never did get the banana bounty they promised me..."
"#00972","Lord <fname>! We've received reports that the <co=0000ff><0> </co>continue to resist."
,"They're causing trouble for the locals as well. Let's teach them a lesson!"
"#00973","Lord <fname>! A <co=0000ff><0></co> has broken out."
"#00974","So we've acquired a new <co=0000ff><0></co>! Excellent. You can add it to a villager's equipment via the ""<co=0000ff>Special</co>"" menu."
"#00975","Here you can contribute funds to raise troops for the shogun's army."
,"Tap ""<co=0000ff>Info</co>"" to see details about the combat role of each unit."
"#00976","We have a new offering for sale: <co=0000ff><0></co>!"
,"Select the <co=0066cc><1></co> and try changing the goods up for sale."
"#00977","In addition, we have something special for you from His Imperial Majesty: <co=0000ff><1></co>."
"#00978","It seems the <co=0000ff><0></co> has grown stronger since we last faced them."
,"We should confront them again when the time is right."
"#00979","Hello there. I came as soon as I heard that you had acquired a <co=0000ff>land deed</co>."
,"Ah, yes! This is the deed for some land inherited by my family."
,"I thought I'd lost it when I was driven from the capital."
,"I'll give you some land near <name> if you return this to me."
"#00980","Yes! Let's get that land!"
"#00981","Incidentally, I brought along something we completed during our research. I hope you find it useful."
"#00982","Congratulations!<co=3366ff> <0> </co>will henceforth be part of the shogun's forces."
,"Since they're just getting started and still so few, let's help them raise troops when we can."
"#00983","So close. I suspect the shogun's forces simply didn't have enough troops."
,"We should consider raising more troops! Select ""<co=0066cc>Forces</co>"" from the menu to do so."
"#00984","So close...but victory was just out of reach."
,"Let's work on increasing the shogun's forces and training our villagers. Then, on to the next battle!"
"#00985","<co=3366ff><0></co> invoked ""<co=3366ff><1></co>"" and boosted the unit's attack power!"
,"You can check what skills have been invoked by tapping the ""<co=3366ff>Units</co>"" soft key."
"#00986","I see! We should definitely keep this in mind."
,"During battle, you can change the archers' target by tapping the ""<co=3366ff>Units</co>"" soft key on the left."
"#00987","Hello. We've not seen you at the training ground in some time. We've missed you."
,"Some excellent prizes await, so we do hope to see you there soon."
,"Well, I must be off. Until we meet again."
"#00988","Hello. I live in a village nearby..."
,"The <co=3366ff><0></co> have been running rampant, to the point we can't make a decent living."
,"Please, stop them and restore some tranquility to our lives!"
"#00989","Lord <fname>! You've done it!"
,"You've vanquished all the warlords and unified the land!"
,"The shogun was so thrilled he came running here barefoot."
"#00990","I was having some tea when I heard you'd taken the country. I rushed over at once!"
,"Incredible! I wasn't sure you were really up to it, but you did it!"
,"Looks like I'll finally be able to get a good night's sleep. Here, please accept this with my thanks."
"#00991","I can't thank you enough! Until we meet again!"
"#00992","Hello. I am Ieyasu Tokugawa."
,"Thank you for reading the <co=3366ff>Ninja News</co>. Have you found it helpful?"
,"I knew that <name> would be able to restore the shogunate and conquer the land."
,"Defeating all of those warlords must have been quite a task. Well done."
,"Oh, by the way..."
,"I'll be taking over now!"
"#00993","The moment of truth is here! Let's settle this once and for all--with all of Japan as the prize!"
"#00994","Wow. There were whispers of Lord Tokugawa being a decoy, but I never imagined it to be true."
,"We'll never know peace until we bring the true Tokugawa clan to its knees!"
,"This is the final battle. Let's give it everything we've got!"
"#00995","What a terrible foe... The shogunate would surely have fallen if not for <name>!"
,"But true peace has come at last. This seemingly endless war is finally over."
,"In honor of this glorious day, allow me to offer an heirloom long passed down from shogun to shogun."
"#00996","This exquisitely crafted armor will deflect any weapons that fly your way."
,"You can also transfer it over to your next playthrough. Use it well!"
"#00997","What a terrible foe... The shogunate would surely have fallen if not for <name>!"
,"But true peace has come at last. This seemingly endless war is finally over."
,"In honor of this day and your many exploits, allow me to offer <name> this reward."
"#00998","I'd actually planned to give you a family heirloom--some armor--but I can't seem to find it..."
,"Well, thank you again. I'm truly grateful! Farewell."
"#00999","<co=3366ff><0></co> acquired! Researching it will add a new unit to the shogun's army."
,"It should prove a vital asset to our forces, so let's get started on that research!"
"#01000","We got new<co=3366ff> <0></co>. We should be able to research new equipment now."
,"To check the technologies we've acquired so far, select ""<co=3366ff>Village</co>"" from the ""Info"" menu."
"#01001","We inflicted <co=3366ff><0> </co>total damage on our opponents."
,"Damage inflicted is displayed on the right, while damage taken is displayed on the left."
"#01002","We're still readying the training ground. Please wait a bit longer."
"#01003","The <co=3366ff><0></co> has joined us! Have a villager equip it to take it into battle!"
,"Select ""<co=3366ff>Animals</co>"" from the ""Info"" menu to check each animal's abilities."
"#01004","Here you can assign the villagers positions within their respective units."
,"Place those with strong defense in the <co=0066cc>front</co> line. They'll protect those in the rear from the brunt of attacks."
,"Skills that affect an entire unit, like <co=3366ff>Strategy</co> or <co=3366ff>Arrow Resist</co>, last longer from members placed in the <co=3366ff>rear</co>."
"#01005","We got a new<co=3366ff> <0></co>! Villagers can ride it when it's equipped as ""<co=3366ff>Special</co>"" gear."
,"Add a sword or spear as well and the villager can join the cavalry! Take advantage of this!"
"#01006","The <co=0066cc><0></co> hasn't restocked its goods lately."
,"Make sure there are enough workshops and materials nearby."
"#01007","Villagers can sometimes learn new skills when they level up."
"#01008","This is our chance to stop Tokugawa once and for all! Let's crush his ambitions!"
"#01009","That you've grown so strong is impressive indeed!"
,"His Imperial Majesty is elated with <name>'s success."
,"So much so that he's conferred this upon you. It's belonged to the imperial family from time immemorial."
"#01010","T-That's the legendary ninja mail of Kairo! I never imagined His Majesty had it all this time..."
,"It's said that whoever wears it can split into two warriors in battle!"
,"It can be transferred over to your next playthrough, so use it well!"
