A tall order, but it appears we can expect great things from <0> in the future."
"#00682","A New Dish"
"#00683","A new dish has debuted at <0>, the restaurant that our editorial staff has been watching since its grand opening. The addition hasn't escape the notice of local foodies, including Mr. I.M. Eaton Fries, who commented between bites that he would be stopping by the next chance he got.<br><br><0> is said to be developing other new dishes as well, so we will be watching their progress with interest."
"#00684","100th Customer"
"#00685","<0> has served its 100th customer!"
"#00686","Steady Management"
"#00687","One of the restaurants frequented by our editorial staff has been doing so well recently that one might think the national economic downturn was over. They've added new employees, for a total of 6 top-class staff members. Indeed, it can be said that having sufficient help is the key to smooth customer service.<br><br>""We want to provide the best service you can get anywhere,"" said the manager's assistant with an inscrutable expression."
"#00688","A Second Location"
"#00689","We have just learned that the popular restaurant <0> has opened a new location.<br><br>Their success can be attributed to smart management techniques, according to the manager's assistant. ""We just keep growing, and it's all thanks to the boss's management,"" she said bashfully. The day when a <0> location opens up in your town may not be far away. We plan to keep a close eye on <0> in the future."
"#00690","A Third Location"
"#00691","Readers of the Daily Eater are no doubt familiar with <0> but may be surprised to learn that the popular eatery has opened a third location.<br><br>Restaurant industry insiders have commented that the new location was opened only after thorough research and preparation, all performed under a veil of secrecy.<br><br>""We owe all of our success to the boss,"" said the manager's assistant. ""Well, and me, too. I'm kind of an expert on restaurant management, you know..."" she said before launching into a lengthy request for a column of her own in our paper."
"#00692","Expanding Already?"
"#00693","Sources say that the popular restaurant <0> has received permission from the Restaurant Association to expand. This will make it possible to increase the size of its building and also increase the number of dishes it can serve.<br><br>""If you move, you have to start again from a small size,"" explained a building management expert. ""So expanding a location shows that you're ready to stay there for the long haul. Don't forget to use Bearington Construction for all your remodeling needs!"" he said, licking honey from his paws."
"#00694","Customer Satisfaction"
"#00695","Our editorial staff recently conducted a man-on-the-street survey. The results indicate that nearly all customers rate restaurants that they visit.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the taste of the food has a major effect on this score, with customers paying attention to even minor details like whether a dish seems good for their health or whether it smells good. Research and experimentation will likely be necessary to fully meet customers' needs. It won't be easy, but as the saying goes, ""Rome didn't invent spaghetti in a day."""
"#00696","Bearington Construction"
"#00697","It seems that Bearington Construction, which has been hit hard by the recent economic downturn, is canvassing local businesses looking for work. In particular, they are visiting businesses with a large amount of capital, many employees, and many menu items.<br><br>""I know times are tough for everyone, but we're looking to help qualified businesses expand their locations,"" said the CEO of Bearington Construction, his paw apparently caught in the jar of honey he had been eating. Keep an eye out for him."
"#00698","A Perfect Score"
"#00699","Incredibly, one of the restaurants frequented by our editorial staff has received a perfect score of 100 points! We asked the customer in question for a comment. ""The food kept getting better each time I went there. Before I knew it, I had given them a 100! I can't wait to tell my friends about this place!""<br><br>The higher the score, the more likely a customer is to eat in a group or recommend a restaurant to friends, so managers would do well to keep an eye on their scores."
"#00700","A Villain Reappears?!"
"#00701","We have just learned that Wairobot, the criminal robot who had long been confined to police hospital, has escaped. It seems that while in hiding he received an invitation to a certain restaurant and, upon sampling their dishes, was completely restored to health.<br><br>The Space Police, who had recently issued a warning to citizens not to feed Wairobot if he was encountered, have been desperately searching for the fugitive. ""It's our fault that he escaped,"" said a police representative between mouthfuls of ramen noodles. ""Now we just have to try to find him before he reproduces..."" Will Wairobot be captured in time? We're on the edge of our seats."
"#00702","Staff Skills"
"#00703","As the manager of a restaurant, the abilities of your staff may be the biggest factor in your success. We recently asked the chairman of the National Gourmet Association about the most important abilities of restaurant staff.<br><br>According to the chairman, increasing staff members' Speed will reduce the amount of time it takes them to reach customers, allowing them to serve more in the same amount of time. Increasing Appeal will improve your customers' moods. And increasing Cooking will have a positive effect on your dishes.<br><br>""And don't forget to train and level up your staff members every day!"" cried the chairman emphatically."
"#00704","A War for New Customers?!"
"#00705","Attracting new customers is important for any business, and restaurants are no exception. Eateries today are using every method available to them to bring more customers through their doors.<br><br>In particular, <0> has been using ideas from customers to start new services and events, allowing them to greatly boost their customer base. And it seems that the higher customers rate a restaurant, the more likely they are to come up with ideas to promote it. After all, who would know better than the customers themselves?"
"#00706","Treat Local Customers Right"
"#00707","Dummy"
"#00708","What Are Energy Points?"
"#00709","As you may know, Energy Points are stored up when staff members take a break at work. Local professor Energio Energion has been studying Energy Points for years, so we asked him for more information.<br><br>""The more Energy someone has, the more likely they are to find something different when they go outside,"" said the professor after a rambling 4-hour introduction.<br><br>He went on to add that some jobs are more likely to make practical and valuable discoveries, but taking a little time to recover Energy first can result in greater effectiveness than usual. When your staff's Energy bar is full, that may be the best time to go looking for new ingredients."
"#00710","Big Tables"
"#00711","While 4-person tables are the foundation of any restaurant's income, in some cases they may not be the best choice. ""People who don't have friends with them won't sit at big tables,"" said a professor at the State University of Table Studies. ""And even people who have many friends have to be satisfied with a restaurant, or..."" He then trailed off into some indecipherable mumblings. In any case, it seems that watching your customers' behavior and choosing table sizes accordingly is a good idea."
"#00712","A Big Hit"
"#00713","Our continuing series of articles about the attractions of <0> has been a big success. The series, which started by describing how the restaurant got its start, has grown in scope beyond our wildest expectations.<br><br>We rarely praise specific restaurants, but perhaps you could sense our reporter's enthusiasm as you read. <br><br>Well, what are you waiting for? Why not pay <0> a visit?"

"#01200","I've finally reached the pinnacle of the culinary world! I am a 5-star chef!"
,"And it's all thanks to your instruction and support!"
,"There's no higher job to attain in the kitchen, but I'll continue to do my best!"
"#01201","What kind of dish should we develop next?"
"#01202","Our first day is over. We'll be open like this every day from 10 AM to 9 PM."
,"I hope we'll attract a lot of customers!"
,"By the way, we can now develop new dishes."
,"Try selecting <co=3366ff>""Dishes"" > ""Develop Dish""</co> from the menu."
,"I look forward to working with you in the coming month!"
"#01203","Boss, we don't have anyone assigned to the <co=dd0806>floor</co> at Store #<0>."
,"We can't serve any customers like this..."
,"Select ""<co=3366ff>Assign Staff</co>"" and assign someone to the <co=dd0806>floor</co>."
"#01204","Boss, we don't have anyone assigned to the <co=dd0806>kitchen</co> at Store #<0>."
,"We can't serve any customers like this..."
,"Select ""<co=3366ff>Assign Staff</co>"" and assign someone to the <co=dd0806>kitchen</co>."
"#01205","Boss, we haven't selected any dishes to serve at Store #<0>."
,"We can't serve any customers like this..."
,"Select some <co=dd0806>dishes to serve</co> from the ""<co=3366ff>Select Dishes</co>"" menu."
"#01206","Luckily, we had one in the warehouse, so we didn't have to buy it."
"#01207","I also found this hidden stash of money!"
,"Let's put it to good use!"
"#01208","I also found a <co=dd0806>hidden stash of money</co> that I'd forgotten about!"
,"We really need to put it to good use!"
"#01209","Since that staff member's ideal location isn't available, they've been assigned to the <0>."
,"Staff members can work either the kitchen or the floor regardless of their current job."
,"But they'll only grow and develop well in the proper place. Use ""<co=3366ff>Assign Staff</co>' to experiment a bit."
"#01210","Boss! Our <0> is getting really popular!"
,"People are lined up in front of the restaurant!"
,"If we add more <co=3366ff>tables</co>, maybe we can reduce our customers' wait time!"
"#01211","Boss! One of our customers has ordered a second helping of food!"
,"When customers produce a <co=3366ff>blue aura</co>, they'll order more food than usual."
,"We're more likely to get requests for second helpings when the food is really tasty."
"#01212","One of our hardworking staff members has gained a level!"
,"Staff members earn EXP by working hard at the cash register or in the kitchen."
,"This boosts their overall stats and also allows them to do more work!"
"#01213","Boss, I need to talk to you about our financial situation..."
,"We're in the <co=dd0806>red</co>..."
,"But don't worry! Put some staff members<co=3366ff> in the break room </co>and cut back on the management plans..."
,"We'll be in the black again before you know it! This is your chance to show off your skills!"
"#01214","When I told the Restaurant Association about our money troubles, they sent some consolation money!"
,"Let's use it wisely!"
"#01215","Boss..."
,"About the dish we're developing..."
"#01216","Boss..."
,"There's no place for the invited customer to sit down..."
,"They're here alone, so please prepare a <co=dd0806>counter seat</co>..."
"#01217","Our stocking costs have risen quite high, haven't they?"
,"Be sure to keep an eye on our monthly earnings report."
"#01218","The new location is smaller than our current one, but let's work hard to expand it!"
"#01219","Boss! There's something you should keep in mind."
,"While opening a new store or remodeling, moving, or expanding an existing store..."
,"you can't select those management plans until the work is complete."
,"You'll be able to select them again afterward, so just wait a bit."
"#01220","Boss, about the dish we're developing..."
,"The ingredient seemed compatible, but it didn't seem to have much effect."
"#01221","Boss!"
,"Sofas are used by customer groups of 3 or more."
,"You'll also want to provide seating for groups of 2 or less."
