"#00989","Our sources have revealed that <0> has just built a brand new principal's office! And what school would be complete without a place where students can be intimidated and lectured? Of course, some students seem oddly invigorated by being called to the principal's office. The experience can even trigger an aura in some people."
"#00990","Making Friends"
"#00991","According to our research, the students at <0> are a shy bunch. Until recently, none of them had even talked to the opposite sex in the hallways! But <1> took the initiative and broke the ice. Talking with the opposite sex can increase tension, sometimes even triggering an aura. Ah, to be young..."
"#00992","School Expansion"
"#00993","<0> is continuing its steady growth with the addition of a new school gate. Since people naturally use the closest gate, having another one can help them get home more quickly and make your school run more smoothly. You can build a gate at the very edge of the map, but just remember that there has to be a path to it from the Main Gate for it to function."
"#00994","New Plants"
"#00995","Word has it that <0> has obtained some very rare <1> seeds. Planting them in a field will allow them to be harvested. The items that can be harvested will depend on who plants them, and on the environment surrounding the field. Sometimes it can be difficult to actually get a precious seed like this to grow."
"#00996","Teacher Shortage?"
"#00997","During a routine academic study, we discovered something very interesting. Having too few teachers dramatically affects students' grades.|Indeed, some parents of students at <0> have begun to request that new teachers be hired. You can hire new teachers by constructing a new Teachers' Room, but keep in mind that you will need to pay their salaries."
"#00998","A Promising Start"
"#00999","Although it was established only <1> year(s) ago, <0> already has a student who scored 200 points on the national achievement test. This test was created by academic professionals and is conducted by all major schools nationwide. This is a promising start indeed for <0>."
"#01000","A Gifted Scholar?"
"#01001","When we heard that a student had scored 300 points on the national achievement test, we immediately ran to their school. We were pleasantly surprised by what we found. Expertly arranged classrooms and talented teachers are the secret behind this student's performance.|The student, <0>, made the following comment: |""I didn't like studying much before, but just being in this school changed that. Before I knew it, my grades had really improved."""
"#01002","Brain Power"
"#01003","The fact that <1> at <0> got a score of 400 on the national achievement test has become the talk of the teaching world. The test is known around the world for its difficulty, so <0> is sure to see a spike in applicants after this news."
"#01004","A Shocking Score"
"#01005","For the first time, a student has scored 450 points on the national achievement test. We headed to <0> to find it already swarming with reporters. However, the student, <1>, kindly agreed to speak to us, and said, ""I had no idea I would get such a high grade. I'd like to thank my teachers.""|A student with grades like this should have their pick of careers. We are eager to see what the future holds for them."
"#01006","500 Points!!!"
"#01007","The impossible has occurred. Someone has scored a perfect 500 points on the national achievement test! The teachers grading the tests thought at first that there had been some mistake, but it soon became obvious that it was the genuine article. A perfect score!|The student in question, <1>, has been featured on international news programs. ""I was as surprised as anyone when I heard. But I can't let it go to my head. I'll work hard and get 600 points next time. Huh? 500 is the top? Well what do you know...?"""

"#01014","30th Anniversary"
"#01015","<0> has reached its 30th anniversary. Quite frankly, we're surprised at how well the school has done.|Some of the school's many graduates pooled their money to donate a series of Bronze Statues in honor of the achievement. We have a feeling this school is just getting started."
"#01016","50th Anniversary"
"#01017","Incredibly, <0> has now reached its 50th anniversary. This game's developers are impressed by your persistence!|""Thanks for playing our game,"" they were heard to say. ""There probably won't be any more events after this one, but feel free to email us your impressions of the game!"""

"#01020","10 Students"
"#01021","With the addition of a recent transfer student, <0> has now reached 10 students. The school is rapidly becoming part of the community, and the number of potential students is on the rise. <1>, the 10th student, talked to us briefly.

"#01022","20 Students"
"#01023","With the addition of a recent transfer student, <0> has now reached 20 students, bringing the school to an impressive size.

"#01024","First Event"
"#01025","<0> hosted its first school event--a <1>. The student body seemed quite excited by the new experience, and it will no doubt attract new students of all types."
"#01026","Tuition Increase"
"#01027","<0> recently successfully completed an academic challenge. Completing challenges will raise the school's educational level and boost students' grades. It will also increase tuition, making it a bit easier on the administrative side. Upon hearing of the increase, one parent commented that they would be happy to pay more if it meant getting a better education for their child."
"#01028","Challenges"
"#01029","Schools can perform challenges for each of the subjects available. When a student successfully completes a challenge, it boosts the academic level of the school and increases monthly tuition. According to a survey of major schools, successfully completing challenges helps students learn, and make student life more enjoyable."
"#01030","Untapped Potential"
"#01031","The beneficial effects of academic challenges on student performance are well known (not to mention the boost to school tuition). But it seems that some schools have not tried any challenges recently.|This has become a subject of discussion at the <0> PTA, with some parents wondering if the administrators aren't afraid to fail. While it's true that challenges cost money, they are undeniably effective. Why not give them a try?"
"#01032","Letting It Slide"
"#01033","Special classes have a direct effect in improving student performance, but some schools have not been using them.|It has been quite some time since <0> held such a class. Students there have been heard to comment that they like to do something different from time to time.|Special classes do consume Research Points, but when used well they can have a big effect on student performance and placement rate."
"#01034","Placement Tests"
"#01035","It's that time of year again--3rd year placement tests are next month. These tests finalize students' post-graduation plans and can have a big effect on their lives. Of course not every student can realize their dream. For some, changing to a more realistic plan is advisable. In these cases, school administrators should consider giving them career guidance. The ""Career Book"" item can be particularly handy for this. "
"#01036","Following"
"#01037","Today, we'd like to introduce the ""Follow"" command. If you open a student's info screen and touch the ""Follow"" button, you can follow them around the school. Observing a student's actions can help you plan where to put certain facilities."
"#01038","Big Success"
"#01039","Graduation is over, and a new batch of students is making its way into the workplace. But it's the one making <3> a year that everyone's talking about.|<1>, a graduate of <0>, will be working in the lucrative <2> field. ""I'm excited to get such a high paying job,"" they said.

""Now it's time to try to give something back to society."""
"#01042","Continued Expansion"
"#01043","<0> recently became a ""<1>."" In honor of this achievement, the maximum number of Teachers' Rooms has been increased.|Now that the school can hire more teachers, they're well on their way to further growth. But they'll need higher grades and more Popular Spots before they can reach the next level."
"#01044","Secret of Growth"
"#01045","Good news for schools struggling to expand: a recent study shows that Popular Spots are essential for school growth. Popular Spots are formed when compatible facilities are built near each other. Check the ""Spot Guide"" menu for more information."
"#01046","Educational Grant"
"#01047","Legislation passed this fall gives each school in the country a grant intended for school events or other activities. Schools across the country are already making plans for this unexpected windfall."
"#01048","Limited Facilities"
"#01049","A recent investigation by our editorial department has uncovered a shocking truth: <0> has a limited number of facility types for a school its size. One student commented that they were tired of the same kind of activities every day, and expressed a desire for something fresh and new. Increasing the types of facilitites present in a school can give you access to unusual career paths as well."
"#01050","Auras"
"#01051","Students can sometimes trigger an aura while using different facilities. According to our research, the higher the facility's School Spirit, the more likely a student is to trigger an aura there. One easy way to increase Spirit is to plant Woods or Flowers near a facility. Placing compatible facilities near each other can also greatly increase Spirit."
"#01052","Too Few Teachers"
"#01053","According to our sources, students are reluctant to transfer to <0> due to a shortage of teachers. A teacher at another school said, ""When I visited the school, the staff were very overworked. I could tell they needed more teachers."" Hiring more teachers might increase the number of transfer students."
"#01054","A New Club"
"#01055","<0> now has a <1>. Although it doesn't yet have any members, it's only a matter of time. Clubs can add a little excitement and camaraderie to school life."
"#01056","Locker Room"
"#01057","<0> has recently added a Locker Room--a welcome addition for those engaged in any kind of physical activity. In the Locker Room, students can change into jerseys, increasing their movement range. Some may even perform special actions, like scrubbing the floors as they move."
"#01058","A New Couple"
"#01059","We've just received word that the first couple has appeared at <0>. The names have been redacted for privacy purposes, but one half of the happy couple said, ""I'm sure this is fate. I'm so glad I decided to come to <0>!"" Couples have a variety of effects on school life, such as increasing the time spent talking in hallways. We wish them the best of luck."
"#01060","Secrets of Couples"
"#01061","Recently announced research indicates that facilities with high School Spirit are indispensible for creating new couples. Of course a student's success when asking someone out will also depend on their Popularity. Holding school events can increase interaction between students, possibly making more likely for new couples to be created."
"#01062","Instrument Shelters"
"#01063","Instrument Shelters contain thermometers and other instruments vital for raising crops, but this came as a surprise to student <0>. ""I always thought little elves lived in there, I figured they helped take care of our crops. I guess there's still a lot I have to learn, huh?"""
