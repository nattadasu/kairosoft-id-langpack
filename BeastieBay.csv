"#01112","▼Character Bonuses<br>Brisk: Higher speed<br>Diligent: Stronger work ethic<br>Clever: Higher intelligence<br>Stubborn: Higher defense<br>Cranky: Stronger attack<br>Studious: EXP boost"
"#01113","▼Equipment Slots & Rank<br>Allies are ranked according to their abilities relative to others of their species. A higher star rating means greater growth potential, more skills, and more equipment slots."
"#01114","▼Combat<br>Use allies strategically, commanding them to attack or use special skills. Item usage and formation changes each use up a turn. Using auras can give you an edge in battle."
"#01115","▼Auras<br>Taking damage charges allies' combat gauges until they can activate an aura. This happens more quickly with some character types than others. Certain skills can also accelerate this."
"#01116","▼Restarting Expeditions and Battles<br>If you suspend an exploratory expedition or flee a battle, you can resume them anytime without losing your treasure chests. If you're defeated in battle, you will lose your treasure chests but can restart and try again."
"#01117","▼Healing Allies<br>Severely wounded allies will recover automatically if they have housing on your island. You can also heal them immediately by using recovery items."
"#01118","▼Taming New Allies<br>You can tame enemies weakened in combat by tossing them bait. Certain types of bait work best with certain types of enemies (e.g., water bait for water-aligned enemies)."
"#01119","▼Allies' Growth Spurts<br>Some species undergo a growth spurt once they reach a certain level. During this phase, their abilities develop rapidly each time they gain a level."
"#01120","▼Exploration Rate<br>An island's ""Explored"" progress meter will rise as you venture into unexplored areas and make them safe. It will reach 100% once you've completed all areas."
"#01121","▼Completion Rate<br>Defeating hordes of enemies and finding lots of boulders, trees, and treasure chests will increase an island's ""Completed"" progress meter. You can accomplish this by exploring areas repeatedly."
"#01122","▼Food<br>You'll get hungry as you explore, and each member of your party will consume one unit of food. After level 16, the number consumed will increase by one for every eight levels gained."
"#01123","▼Remodeling<br>Placing certain buildings or other additions near homes or natural terrain may qualify the latter for remodeling. Renovations can accelerate recovery or harvest speed, so remodel whenever possible."
"#01124","▼Energy<br>Place power generators near buildings to increase their energy supply. More energy can trigger a number of different renovations."
"#01125","▼Equipment<br>Each ally has a limited number of equipment slots, which varies according to the individual's skill. Some types of gear take up more slots than others. Only one weapon can be equipped at a time."
"#01126","▼Pumpkin Products<br>As you travel the world, you'll get the opportunity to improve trade with other islands. Doing so will broaden the selection of merchandise available at Pumpkin Products."
"#01127","▼Research<br>Build a research lab and you'll be able to research a variety of useful gear. Invest at least one piece of lumber and the research will begin automatically. Just remember that a mere 1% investment can lead to failure."
"#01128","▼Tourists<br>As you explore other islands, their residents will begin visiting yours and make the rounds of your tourist attractions. The more extensive your roads, the further they will wander."
"#01129","▼Tourist Attractions<br>Up to five specialties harvested within the eight squares surrounding a shop can be stocked there and sold to tourists. Prices vary by specialty type."
"#01130","▼Survival Gear<br>Survival gear created through research has a level that reflects how easily it breaks when used, how effective it is, etc. You can even discover new methods of transport, so conduct research often."
"#01131","▼Instructors<br>Once you collect 15 allies, you can register one as an instructor. If you build a school and assign an instructor to it, any allies within the eight surrounding squares will automatically acquire EXP. High-level instructors are most effective."
"#01132","▼Instructor-Pupil Compatibility<br>If an instructor and pupil have different personalities but share the same elemental affinity, the pupil gains more experience points. Pupils who have surpassed the instructor's level will find it difficult to enter the school."
"#01133","▼Auto-Combat<br>In the latter half of the game, you'll be able to use an auto-combat feature that allows allies to fight non-boss battles automatically. You can still issue commands manually along the way by selecting Menu > Allies."
"#01134","▼Sharing through Magic Words<br>You can acquire new instructors by learning the magic words required (i.e., passwords) from other players. A trial incantation is posted somewhere on the PC version of the Kairo Park website."
"#01135","▼Play Time Bonus<br>Whenever you exit and restart the game, you can receive a bonus of one medal for every seven minutes played. This does not include time spent with menus open or with your character standing still."
"#01136","▼Repeated Playthroughs<br>The game ""ends"" in the 6th year, but you can continue playing for as long as you like. You can also carry some of your data over into a new game, making it easier to get a high score the next time."
"#01137","▼Rankings<br>After completing the game, you can check the title screen for weekly rankings of players around the world. Select the Hall of Fame rankings to see the top 10 scores of all time."
"#01138","▼Hard Mode<br>Once you've completed the game, you can select ""Hard Mode"" when starting a new game from the title screen. This mode features stronger enemies and more potent skill effects."

"#01191","Dr. Mochipon Rises"
"#01192","   Dr. Mochipon recently came to Earth, blazing onto the scene like a comet, and his shadowy organization has evidently sprung into action. With surprising candor he informed us, ""We've begun by scattering fattening foods around the planet. We're going to make a fortune selling diet products! First we'll take Earth, then the entire galaxy! Mwahahaha!"" He broke off in a fit of snorting and mumbling, at which point we thought it prudent to take our leave.<br>   But the enigmatic Chimpan Z, calling himself Dr. Chimpan, has resolved to thwart this nefarious scheme. While speaking at length on exotic bananas recently, he mentioned that he plans to launch a new robot security brigade and is determined to restore interplanetary peace.<br>   Who will prevail? Our intrepid reporters will continue to follow this cosmic conflict closely in another game..."

,"You'd best wait until you return before changing party members."
"#01505","There are no alternates available."
,"Try exploring and <co=0070c0>capturing some new beasts</co>."
"#01506","There are no main members in the front line."
"#01507","Our party's main members are all <co=0070c0>wounded</co> and can't fight!"
"#01508","There won't be any members left."
"#01509","You've left treasure chests in <0>."
,"You'll lose <co=ff0000><1></co> if you change destinations now..."
"#01510","Our party's main members are all <co=0070c0>wounded</co> and can't come along..."
"#01511","We don't have enough <0>. You won't accomplish much if you go hungry."
"#01512","Hello! I'll be your assistant."
,"I've been helping people develop deserted islands for 40 years now. Ask me anything."
,"Let's develop <island> into an island renowned the world over!"
,"If you have any questions over the course of the game, select ""Tutorial"" from the menu."
,"First, you'll want to select ""<co=0070c0>Build</co>"" from the menu and build a <co=0070c0>home for your ally</co>."
"#01513","We've discovered a road near the house leading to some unknown terrain!"
,"Why not take some allies along and explore it?"
"#01514","Try selecting the <co=0070c0>blue area</co>."
,"I wonder what lies ahead..."
"#01515","It's been living outdoors since you destroyed its house."
,"It will live outdoors until it has a bed of its own."
,"Let's rebuild its house soon!"
"#01518","Thank you for building me a research lab."
,"I'm Chimpan Z, a chimp with an IQ of <co=0070c0>108</co>. I have a particular knack for engineering and robotics."
,"My dream is to use this lab to construct the most advanced security bots ever seen!"
,"I'll be working as <co=0070c0>Dr. Chimpan</co>. Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to get in touch anytime."
"#01519","I can't perform research without a lab..."
,"Please build me one as soon as you can."
"#01520","By the way, we discovered an <co=0070c0>old dock</co> in that last area."
,"If we only had a boat, we could invite tourists to come here."
,"First, we'll have to learn how to negotiate with other islands..."
"#01521","I think I might be able to help."
,"If I had a house on this island, I'm sure I could contribute to its development."
,"Please give me a place to live."
"#01522","I've harnessed the latest technology and finally completed...a <co=0070c0>raft</co>!"
,"With it you should now be able to travel to <co=0070c0>other islands</co>!"
"#01523","Excellent! I've just looked into the nearby islands for you."
,"Let's take a look at the map."
"#01524","From now on, you can view the map at any time by pressing the left soft key."
,"If you look on the map, you'll see ""Tiny Isle."""
,"Once you've explored enough of <island>, you can explore another island."
"#01525","From now on, I'll use <island> as my base of operations!"
,"Take a look at my selection."
"#01526","Welcome!"
"#01527","Thank you."
,"Your gold won't increase unless tourists visit <island>."
,"It would be nice if we could travel to nearby islands..."
,"But I suppose you had better work on exploring <island> first."
,"You can call me anytime by selecting <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Shop</co> from the menu."
"#01528","Come again."
"#01529","Heh. Welcome."
"#01530","My shop sells medals renowned the world over for their rarity and value."
,"They're not cheap, so think before you buy."
,"Heh."
"#01531","My shop will be here from now on, so stop by anytime."
"#01532","Heh. See you."
"#01533","Greetings!"
"#01534","Our agency introduces beasts from around to world to new masters."
,"Even I don't know what will emerge each time. It keeps things fresh!"
,"Come and try your luck whenever you like!"
,"By the way, using this service triggers an <co=0070c0>autosave</co>, so use it only when you want to save your game."
"#01535","I've been secretly keeping tabs on the beasts you've faced, so I can add them to our selection."
"#01536","Exploration is hard work, and naturally you'll get hungry."
,"Your party can recover so long as you have <co=ff0000>enough food</co> for each member."
,"I've heard that beasts require more food as they gain levels."
,"You can't do anything on an empty stomach, after all."
"#01538","We've run out of <co=ff0000>provisions</co>... We'll have to head home."
"#01539","While I was out walking, I spotted a <co=0070c0>cozy place to rest</co>."
"#01540","If we only had gear that would make napping easier."
"#01541","I see!"
,"I just got an idea for something that will allow you to rest anywhere!"
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to give me the go-ahead."
"#01542","Thanks to this <co=0070c0>siesta set</co>, we should be able to rest comfortably."
,"Our whole party should be able to recover its strength!"
"#01543","There's an enormous boulder blocking the path. I guess we'll have to go around..."
"#01544","If we only had a <co=0070c0>hammer</co>, we could make more efficient progress."
,"We need some survival gear..."
"#01545","I see!"
,"I just got an idea for a tool that can shatter boulders."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to give me the go-ahead."
"#01546","Good thing we have this hammer. We can just smash the boulder and continue on."
"#01547","A giant tree is blocking the path. We'll have to go around..."
"#01548","If we only had an <co=0070c0>axe</co>, we could make more efficient progress."
,"We need some survival gear..."
"#01549","I've got it!"
,"I just got an idea for a tool that can chop up trees."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to give me the go-ahead."
"#01550","Luckily we've got an axe, so we'll just chop our way through and continue on."
"#01551","All this grass is kind of annoying."
"#01552","Looks like we need a <co=0070c0>sickle</co> for mowing grass."
,"We need some survival gear..."
"#01553","Of course!"
,"I just got an idea for a tool that can mow down tall grass."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to give me the go-ahead."
"#01554","Glad we have this sickle. It should be perfect for the job."
"#01555","There's something here under the ground. I wonder what it could be..."
"#01556","I'll bet we could dig it up if we had a <co=0070c0>shovel</co>."
,"We need some survival gear..."
"#01557","Leave this to me!"
,"I just got an idea for a tool that can dig anything up from the ground."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to give me the go-ahead."
"#01558","Since we have a shovel, let's try digging it up."
"#01559","It seems that there's a mysterious artifact in the middle of this area."
"#01560","According to my research, if you pour water over it, any beasts nearby will get stronger."
,"If we only had a watering can..."
"#01561","I've got it!"
,"I just had an idea for a revolutionary new tool that allows you to pour water anywhere."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu to give me the go-ahead."
"#01562","Let's try using this watering can we brought along."
,"I think it might increase the level of this location!"
"#01563","According to my research, the enemies in this area may also have grown stronger."
,"And it's also easier to meet beasts with a high rank."
,"If you meet a particularly promising beast, you might try taming it."
"#01565","A route to a mysterious unexplored land has been discovered!"
"#01566","We've discovered a hidden cave!"
,"If you complete this expedition and then select this location again, a new course will appear."
,"Who knows what might be hidden there?"
"#01567","My house has fulfilled the conditions for remodeling!"
"#01568","From now on, a cruise ship will be coming to <island>."
"#01569","Everyone on Carre Isle worked together to build a road over the sea!"
,"Tourists should be able to travel here more comfortably now!"
"#01570","It's such a nice road that I'm thinking about coming by car from now on."
"#01571","Everyone on Metro Isle worked together to build railroad tracks over the sea!"
,"Tourists should be able to travel here more comfortably now!"
"#01572","It's such a nice train that I'm thinking about coming by rail from now on."
"#01573","I'm all moved in."
,"I never imagined I'd be blessed with such a nice home."
,"Thank you."
"#01574","I'm all moved in."
,"I'll do my best to help <co=0070c0>harvest food and lumber</co> in the eight squares around my house."
"#01575","I'm all moved in."
,"I've had my eye on this house for a long time. It's very comfortable."
,"As they say, home is where you keep your cat! Or something like that. Thanks!"
"#01576","I'm done moving in."
,"I had a bigger house in mind, but as they say, wherever you hang your hat is home!"
,"Or was it cat? Anyway, thanks!"
"#01577","I'm all moved in."
,"A home of my own at last. I'm so happy."
"#01578","Pardon me, but I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep without a house..."
"#01579","Excuse me...but I'd love to have a place I can call home."
"#01580","Um... Would you consider building me a home of my own?"
"#01587","Thank goodness. I've been stranded with nothing but bananas to eat for days."
,"I just arrived on a whale's back."
,"This is a nice place you've got here. I'd like to live here if you don't mind."
"#01588","Heh. I just opened a new shop here on <island>."
,"I hope to earn some cash to fund my political career."
,"Please accept this as a token of our new relations."
"#01589","Now that I have a nice shop..."
,"I think I'll start selling products from islands around the world."
"#01590","Hello. I'm thrilled to announce that my beast HR agency, 12 years in the making, is now open!"
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Agency</co> from the menu to call me anytime."
"#01591","We found a <co=0070c0>treasure chest</co> on our expedition!"
,"Since we're still out exploring, we'll have to wait until we get home to see what's inside."
"#01592","I can't wait until you get back!"
"#01593","A beast has attacked!"
"#01594","I guess it's up to my ally now!"
"#01595","If allies get into trouble, help them out with <co=0070c0>items</co>."
"#01596","That was close, but my quick judgment got us through."
,"Let's keep exploring."
"#01597","According to some documents I have here..."
,"Offering a weakened beast <co=0070c0>bait</co> can be an effective strategy."
,"The key is to not give up!"
"#01598","I had some ingredients left over from my research, so..."
,"I made a <co=0070c0>recovery item</co> while I was at it."
,"Please put it to good use."
"#01599","I had some ingredients left over from my research, so..."
,"I came up with something I think you could build."
,"Please put it to good use."
"#01600","I had some ingredients left over from my research, so..."
,"I came up with a new piece of <co=0070c0>equipment</co>."
,"Please put it to good use."
"#01601","I had some ingredients left over from my research, so..."
,"I came up with a new <co=0070c0>scroll</co>."
,"Please put it to good use."
"#01602","I had some ingredients left over from my research, so..."
,"I came up with some <co=0070c0>bait that beasts should like</co>."
,"Please put it to good use."
"#01603","My research yielded a <co=0070c0>Life Elixir 1</co>."
,"You can find it under <co=0070c0>Items</co> > <co=0070c0>Supplies</co>."
"#01604","My research yielded two pieces of meager bait."
,"You can find it under <co=0070c0>Items</co> > <co=0070c0>Supplies</co>."
"#01605","Oh, dear... My shop and home are gone..."
,"I'd like to reopen the shop as soon as possible. Please build me a house...."
"#01606","Heh. My shop and home are gone..."
,"I'd like to reopen the shop as soon as possible. Please build me a house...."
"#01607","I'm a bit nervous, but I'm going to muster all my courage and go exploring!"
"#01608","Look! It's a nocturnal beast! They only come out at night, you know!"
,"It's pretty rare for them to come out when people are around."
"#01609","Look! It's a beast that only appears in the early morning!"
,"It's pretty rare for them to come out when people are around."
"#01610","Look! It's a beast that likes the twilight and appears only in the evening!"
,"It's pretty rare for them to come out when people are around."
"#01611","Look! It's a beast that likes the sun and appears only in the daytime!"
,"It's pretty rare for them to come out when people are around."
"#01612","Thank you so much for helping our island."
,"I hope to work with <island> in the future for our mutual growth and prosperity."
,"If you select our island and choose ""Invest,"" I think you'll find it beneficial for both parties."
,"We'll be waiting."
"#01613","I never thought you would be able to drive out all of those terrible beasts!"
,"Thank you. I look forward to working with <island> for our mutual growth and prosperity."
,"If you select our island and choose ""<co=0070c0>Invest</co>,"" I think you'll find it beneficial for both parties."
,"We'll be waiting."
"#01614","Thank you so much for helping our island."
,"I was so ecstatic over my second chance at life that I bought up all the video games on the market."
,"Unfortunately, I no longer have the money to send out sightseeing ships."
,"If you would invest in our island, I can use it to improve our transportation options."
,"Well, I must be going."
"#01615","Thank you for helping our people!"
,"It seems that they're all dying to visit <island> now."
,"I'm sure you'll be seeing a lot of us from now on!"
"#01616","Thank you for your help earlier!"
,"I'd like to take the lead and visit <island>."
,"I look forward to a long friendship in the days to come."
"#01617","Eek! Help!"
,"A strange robot is attacking!"
"#01618","I don't have a house..."
"#01619","We finally have tourists coming to <island>!"
,"We should try conducting some <co=0070c0>research on tourism</co>!"
"#01620","Did I hear the word ""research""?"
,"I've got a great idea for tourism research."
,"Just give the word via <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research </co>from the menu<co=0070c0> </co>and I'll get started!"
"#01621","Help! A strange beast has taken me captive!"
,"I can't move in these ropes!"
"#01622","This is serious! We'd better go save him."
"#01623","Hey!"
,"You there! Help me!"
"#01624","Heh heh. Humans. Gotta catch 'em all!"
"#01625","Thank goodness! Our ship sank and I washed up on <island>."
,"I think a number of people are probably here..."
,"By the way, do you know of any good locations for a shop?"
,"I'm sure it would be useful to you."
"#01626","It wasn't easy, but this area is now safe!"
,"That's a relief!"
,"The only beasts left in the area now dwell in a nearby <co=0070c0>cave</co>."
,"Try going there if you want to capture some."
"#01627","ALL OBSTACLES WILL BE ELIMINATED!"
"#01628","YOU BEAT ME... DOES NOT COMPUTE!"
"#01629","We've discovered an old deserted grocery stand on the island."
"#01630","I guess it's just left over from a long time ago."
,"Upkeep would cost a bit, but maybe we could use it to <co=0070c0>attract tourists</co>!"
,"Anyway, let's get back to <co=0070c0>exploring <island></co> first."
"#01631","Thank you for saving me!"
,"I can't get home, so I'd like to live on <island>. I'll stop by to borrow ingredients occasionally."
,"I'm not a bad cook if I do say so myself. I'd like to try opening a restaurant."
,"Well, bye."
"#01632","We're back from the <co=0070c0>Damp Cave</co>."
"#01633","Welcome back."
,"That cave is quite deep, so you can try exploring it as many times as you like."
"#01634","I'd just returned home and was rummaging around my sprawling manor..."
,"And I came across an <co=0070c0>old map of <island></co>."
,"According to this map, the island still contains some unexplored terrain."
,"Well, I must be going."
"#01635","Who would've thought there would be land hidden somewhere on <island>?"
"#01636","We found <co=0070c0>another dock</co>. Funny, it was right under our noses all this time."
,"Let's hurry up and explore!"
"#01637","Thank you!"
,"I'll do whatever I can to use my knowledge for the good of <island>."
"#01638","It sounds like another mysterious robot has gone berserk."
"#01639","YOU AGAIN?! YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED!"
"#01640","I'M SORRY!"
"#01641","About that robot... I have the strangest feeling that I made it myself--a long time ago, I mean."
,"But I honestly have no clear memories of anything that far back due to my memory loss."
,"It all seems like something that happened on another planet..."
"#01642","Whew. Thank you."
,"I had almost given up on anyone rescuing me. I had just started talking to this basketball..."
,"That was close..."
,"I hope I can do something to help <island> from now on."
"#01643","Boing boing."
"#01644","Boooiiing."
"#01645","Could it be?! The lord of <island>!"
,"I thought it was just a legend..."
,"We may not stand a chance against an adversary like that..."
,"But if we go in prepared, we just might win!"
"#01646","Greetings. Are you lost, perchance?"
,"Please, allow me to guide you..."
,"To hell!"
"#01647","Dragons are immortal! We cannot be defeated!"
"#01648","At last, we've defeated the lord of the island!"
,"Now <island> is finally safe."
,"It's been a long journey... I'm getting a little choked up..."
"#01649","Hello."
,"I am the president of an island near <island>."
,"Recently, we've had terrible trouble with beast attacks."
,"We would be honored if the one who brought peace to <island> could help us with our problem as well."
,"Just tap the left soft key ""<co=0070c0>Map</co>"" and then select ""<co=0070c0>Carre Isle</co>"" to visit us. We'll be waiting!"
"#01650","I guess news travels fast!"
,"Let's go there when you're ready."
"#01651","We've arrived at the new island."
,"It looks quite nice, but where are all the people?"
,"These beast attacks must really be bad."
"#01652","Thank you for coming!"
,"My people are suffering terribly at the hands--er, paws--of these beasts."
,"Please help us!"
"#01653","I don't know if it will help, but I collected some leftovers from yesterday's dinner."
,"Please take them with my compliments."
"#01654","The other islands seem quite well developed..."
,"Unfortunately, we don't have the rights to <co=0070c0>build</co> anything in their territory."
,"But at least we can look at their buildings and get some tips to use on <island>."
"#01655","Thank goodness you found me! I was adrift for ages and then sought shelter in that cave."
,"I thought I was done for. Thank you."
,"I'd like to repay this kindness, so I've decided to move to your island."
,"Please..."
,"Would you give me a place to live?"
"#01656","Thank you for saving me!"
,"I'm a carpenter, and was sawing down a tree when it trapped me underneath it."
,"Please let me come to your island to live. I must do something to repay my debt to you."
,"Please..."
,"Would you give me a place to live?"
"#01657","I thank you, friend. I owe you my life."
,"I have languished here so long..."
,"Zounds, what century is this?"
,"I've no hope of returning home, it seems. Would you allow me a place on your island?"
,"I would be most grateful if you would provide me a home there."
"#01658","Thank you for saving me!"
,"I've never seen someone use a sickle with more skill."
,"I think I'd like to move to your island, if only to learn your sickle-handling skills!"
,"Please..."
,"Would you give me a place to live?"
"#01659","It seems that the person we just saved is going to visit us as a tourist."
,"That should be interesting."
"#01660","Heh heh heh. What tasty-looking morsels..."
,"I'll eat you all alive!"
"#01661","Never mind... I'm on a diet anyway..."
"#01662","Did you come to rescue me?"
,"I got lost, and with all of these beasts about, I didn't know what to do..."
,"It looks like I can make it home safely now."
,"I'd like to visit <island> sometime soon."
"#01663","Oh, thank you."
,"I was traveling around the island helping my friends when I got lost."
,"Now I can finally return to my old life."
,"Maybe I can even visit <island> sometime soon."
"#01664","Hey! This island belongs to me!"
"#01665","Aw, man!"
"#01666","Hello. I have heard much about you and your exploits."
,"Fearsome beasts have been wreaking havoc on our island over the past week."
,"They sink our ships, devour our food, and even jaywalk! It's horrible!"
,"Please, help restore peace to our island!"
,"Select <co=0070c0>Map</co> > <co=0070c0>Metro Isle</co> to visit us. We're counting on you!"
"#01667","Welcome! Thank you for coming!"
,"As you can see, our island is being overrun. I don't even know where most of our citizens have gone."
,"I've had to shut myself indoors. It's all I can do to make a telephone call like this."
"#01668","This is serious!"
,"Let's head there immediately to restore peace to the island!"
"#01669","Thank you."
,"Ever since the Chubking attacked, the entire town has been in a panic."
,"I think the Chubking is causing trouble in the ""Capital River"" area over there."
,"Thanks to you, I can now go home safely."
,"I'd like to visit <island> sometime soon."
"#01670","Oh! That's it!"
,"My bag of work tools is apparently on the Wide Plateau."
"#01671","Thanks for finding my bag."
,"This should improve my offerings at the shop!"
,"Thank you again."
"#01672","There! That's him!"
,"The Chubking has been spreading fake donuts around the island and stealing our snacks..."
,"He's a monster!"
"#01673","It sounds like the mastermind behind all of the trouble on this island is right over there."
,"Let's go take care of him."
"#01674","Pardon me, traveler. Have you seen my lunch anywhere around here?"
,"Would you mind looking for it?"
,"Oh well... If I can't find it..."
,"I guess you'll do!"
"#01675","What the foie gras?!"
"#01676","Ah!"
,"It's him!"
,"That man in the strange machine is the culprit behind all the chaos on our island!"
"#01677","It looks like we've found the true culprit at last."
,"I don't know who he is, but I'm sure we can take him!"
"#01678","Heh heh..."
,"Now that I'm all healed up, I plan to use this evil-looking robot to conquer the galaxy!"
,"..."
,"Wait! That simian in the white coat... It's...the doctor?!"
,"If you insist on interfering, I'll blow you to bits!"
"#01679","Ouch!"
"#01680","Who was that guy, anyway?"
"#01681","That shady fellow took off somewhere in a small boat..."
,"Too bad he got away."
"#01682","So we meet again!"
,"I won't let you interfere with my plans to take over the galaxy with my robot brigade!"
,"I'll make mincemeat of you all!"
"#01683","Darn it!"
,"I still have a special prototype robot left!"
,"You just wait and see!"
"#01684","It seems that this island was once a summer resort of some kind."
,"But now it seems to be deserted."
,"Now that we're here, we might as well look for some treasure, right?"
"#01685","Hello. I am the king of a desert country quite distant from <island>."
,"Recently, it seemed that our oil wells had gone dry. It turned out that wild beasts had attacked them!"
,"I got lost after setting out to hunt them down..."
,"That's why I'm sending out an SOS."
,"Help!"
"#01686","Another distress call..."
,"Let's head to that island immediately!"
"#01687","It's sweltering... I'd heard it was a desert, but I didn't expect it to be this bad..."
,"Let's get this expedition rolling before we collapse from the heat."
"#01688","Ha ha ha! You let your guard down because you thought I was a simple crawfish, didn't you!"
,"Taste my stinger!"
"#01689","I knew I shouldn't have taken you on!"
"#01690","Those scorpion things were just about to have me for lunch."
,"I was thinking that all my wealth couldn't save me now..."
,"Thank you!"
,"Once the problems around the island are taken care of, I'd like to send out a sightseeing boat."
,"See you later."
"#01691","Whew, thanks."
,"I thought he looked familiar, but when I called out to him I was seized and nearly launched into space."
,"If you don't mind, I'd like to set up shop on your island."
,"I'm sure I can be of some use to you!"
,"But I will need a house..."
"#01692","I've just received some information about a new island."
"#01693","This time it's cold... Really cold..."
,"If we had a fire-breathing ally, we wouldn't need a heater..."
,"Anyway, we'd better get going!"
"#01694","Hello! I represent a rather chilly country. Freezing, actually..."
,"We're sending out a distress signal after hearing of your many impressive feats."
,"We need your help!"
"#01695","Thank you."
,"But the country is still overrun by fearsome beasts..."
,"Please help us!"
"#01696","So c-c-cold... Thank goodness you came. I nearly turned into a human popsicle."
,"If you don't mind, I'd like to go to <island>. It seems nice and warm..."
,"Thank you."
"#01697","Hi there!"
,"You look cold and tired."
,"Well then, why not take a rest?"
,"...In a block of ice!"
"#01698","Noooo!"
"#01699","Brrrrrr!"
"#01700","Uggghh!"
"#01701","We've arrived at an active volcanic island."
,"It looks like lava could shoot out at any moment."
,"I don't see any signs of inhabitation."
,"But there do seem to be some strong beasts here. Watch yourself."
"#01702","How nice of you to visit this scorching volcanic wasteland."
,"I don't get many guests..."
,"Why don't you stay?"
,"Forever!"
"#01703","You burn me up!"
"#01704","I will defeat you!"
,"No, I will defeat you!"
,"Well then..."
,"I will defeat you, too!"
"#01705","We lost!"
"#01706","Hello..."
,"Our island was quite technologically advanced, but..."
,"The beasts that appeared recently laid waste to our home, and now it's little more than ruins."
,"Now they have full run of the island."
,"We're counting on the heroes of <island> to restore us to our former glory."
"#01707","Another island in trouble."
,"We'd better get going."
"#01708","We've arrived at the new island."
,"This seems to be the most mysterious location in these parts."
,"And I think it may be the last island, too..."
,"But I could be wrong."
"#01709","Ha-haa!"
,"I am behind all of the bedwetting that occurs throughout the world!"
,"You think you can defeat me?!"
"#01710","I'm sorry...."
"#01711","That's him!"
,"Ever since that guy appeared, our island has been in a terrible state!"
,"You have to defeat him!"
"#01712","Let's see if we can show him the error of his ways."
"#01713","Grrrr!"
"#01714","Aaagh! Hello!"
"#01715","Aaagh! Goodbye!"
"#01716","What's the story behind that hideous robot?"
,"Do you really think we can defeat it?"
"#01717","I may just be a prototype..."
,"But I can still beat you!"
"#01718","This version of me is no good!"
,"We will meet again!"
"#01719","We did it!"
,"I never thought we would really win!"
"#01720","What a mysterious island..."
,"I wonder what awaits..."
"#01721","What a sinister ship..."
,"What could be lying in wait...?"
,"Well, I'm off to take a shower. Looking forward to your return!"
"#01722","That was certainly a spooky old ghost ship."
,"I guess it's best to let sleeping dogs lie. Let's get out of here."
"#01723","We've cleared all areas of this island."
,"But some areas can be explored multiple times."
,"If you missed some beasts, you can try again."
"#01725","Hello! As you are the world's undisputed beast masters, I would like to tell you about a new island."
,"It's brand new and filled with beasts from around the globe. I hope you'll come visit!"
"#01726","A mysterious ship has appeared."
"#01727","Arrr!"
,"Come to Davy Jones's locker with us!"
"#01728","Agh! Hard to starboard!"
"#01729","The Deserted Island Association has sent us a gift in celebration of our exploring 100% of the island."
,"Let's make good use of it."
"#01730","The island's completion rate has finally reached 100%!"
,"The Deserted Island Association has sent us a special award!"
,"Let's make good use of it."
"#01731","Thanks partly to your investments, trade has really improved."
,"This in turn has improved my <co=0070c0>product selection</co> as well!"
"#01732","We have more <co=0070c0>lumber</co> on hand than we can store."
,"We could store more if we only had a <co=0070c0>lumber shed</co>..."
"#01733","Aha!"
,"In that case, I'd like to start research on a lumber shed!"
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
"#01734","We have more <co=0070c0>food</co> on hand than we can store."

,"I think I could use them to build a generator for our island!"
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
"#01737","Hmm... I found something interesting in that treasure chest earlier."

,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
"#01746","Some of our residents would like to be able to fly to your island."
,"I hope that <island> will be able to accommodate their request."
"#01747","I see... The time has come at last."
,"Very well, then. I'd like to design a <co=0070c0>heliport</co>."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
"#01748","Somebody help!"
"#01749","He sounds like he's in trouble. You'd better go see what's wrong."
,"Good luck! I'll be awaiting your return...while enjoying this cake."
"#01750","You came just in time."
,"Help me!"
"#01751","There's room for only one bear mascot in this town!"
,"And that's ME!"
"#01752","Aagh!"
,"Fine, you can have the job!"
"#01753","You have my thanks. I've been held prisoner for the last four years."
,"And what's worse, I nearly lost my position as official Kairosoft bear!"
,"I think I'll go to <island> to live, if you don't mind."
,"I'm sure I can be of service!"
"#01754","I see you've made a new friend. Be sure to <co=0070c0>build him a house</co>."
"#01755","We're getting quite a number of allies. That should make exploration easier!"
,"We still have room for more, but sooner or later you'll want to say goodbye to some of them."
,"It would be nice if they had lots of things to do after retirement..."
"#01756","Ah! I've been worried about retired allies myself."
,"I've been thinking about <co=0070c0>building schools</co> where they can stay on as instructors."
,"I've already completed one, actually. It's now yours."
"#01757","If you want to build more schools, select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> and let me know!"
"#01758","You certainly have a lot of allies."
,"The more allies you have, the more food and lumber you can harvest."
,"Keep looking for new allies."
"#01759","Having so many allies consumes quite a bit of food..."
,"So I've come up with an idea on how to reduce consumption on expeditions."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
"#01760","You're starting to get low on food."
,"Food is vital whether on expedition or just carrying on with daily life"
,"Make sure you always have a lot on hand."
"#01761","Aha!"
,"You've given me an idea for improving our <co=0070c0>fields</co> for optimal food production."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
,"By the way, I have a little saved up myself. You're welcome to it if you like."
"#01762","We're running low on lumber."
,"Lumber is vital for construction, research, and a variety of other uses."
,"Make sure you always have a lot on hand."
"#01763","I see!"
,"I've got an idea for a <co=0070c0>lumber mill</co> that will help you get more lumber."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
,"By the way, I have a little saved up myself. You're welcome to it if you like."
"#01764","You're running low on <co=0070c0>medals</co>..."
,"You can get medals by exploring islands..."
,"Or by getting bonuses for playing a certain amount of time."
,"But they're very <co=0070c0>rare items</co> that don't come along very often, so use them wisely."
"#01765","Hm? How'd you find me?"
"#01766","What? You found me?!"
"#01767","I see you've run out of gold..."
,"It just so happens that I have a little money stashed away."
,"Please use it for the good of the island."
"#01768","That was quite a battle."
,"If you offer bait to an enemy that's been weakened in combat..."
,"you can sometimes win a new ally."
,"So try offering bait to foes that seem like promising allies."
"#01769","Exploration takes a lot of food."
,"Here, I had some stocked in my boat's refrigerator for just such an occasion."
"#01770","I never knew there was more land hidden there..."
,"Another dock has been discovered. It should be a good place for tourists to land."
,"Keep working on exploring the entire island."
"#01771","Now that you've explored all of Carre Isle, why not promote trade with its residents?"
,"Improving trade should allow me to stock a wider selection of merchandise!"
,"If you decide to invest, select ""Map"" and then select the island."
"#01772","Now that you've explored all of Metro Isle, why not promote trade with its residents?"
,"Improving trade should allow me to stock a wider selection of merchandise!"

,"If you decide to invest, select ""Map"" and then select the island."
"#01776","Hello. I heard that a large beach was discovered on <island>."
,"As a token of friendship, we voted to build a bridge between our islands."
,"However, we are a bit short on funding..."
,"If you invest in our island, a ""Transport"" item will be added."
,"I hope we can count on your support."
"#01777","Hello. I heard that a large mountainous area was discovered on <island>."
,"As a token of friendship, we've voted to build a railroad."
,"However, we are a bit short on funding..."
,"If you invest in our island, a ""Transport"" item will be added."
,"I hope we can count on your support."
"#01778","I'm glad you were able to escape earlier."
,"Fleeing is a good way to protect your treasure chests when you run into an enemy that's too tough."
,"If an enemy's too strong to beat at your current level, try leveling up in a different area."
,"You should be able to get most of your treasure chests back if you try again."
,"This fell to the ground when you fled, by the way."
"#01779","You've got a new ally. You'll want to <co=0070c0>build it a new home</co> on the island."
,"I'm sure it will prove a stalwart companion!"
"#01780","When a beast joins us, it turns over a new leaf and begins anew at level 1."
,"It takes time for an ally to grow and develop, so train it well."
,"By the way, this scroll fell to the ground when you tamed it earlier."
"#01781","I just finished researching a new wagon that can carry more allies!"
,"On your next expedition, you'll be able to bring a three-member + two-member formation!"
,"Further upgrades may be possible from Items > Survival."
,"Why not try adjusting your party configuration?"
"#01782","You can now build a dirt path."
,"Without a path, tourists tend to get tired quickly and may not make it to their destination."
,"But with a simple path, they'll be able to walk to more distant locations!"
"#01783","The cooking set is now finished, making meals eaten during expeditions more effective."
,"Meals will now restore more of your strength."
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01784","I've completed development of my new siesta set!"
,"This will allow your party to rest and recover during expeditions."
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01785","My fishing rod research is now done."
,"We should now be able to collect a lot of food at rivers!"
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01786","I finished my axe research."
,"Now if you find a tree in your way, just chop that sucker down! Think of the time you'll save!"
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01787","I finished my shovel research."
,"Now you can dig up all of those things you find while exploring!"
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01788","I finished my sickle research."
,"Now you can mow down grass on expeditions. Who knows what might be hidden there?"
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01789","I finished my insect net research."
,"It should boost our harvest in meadows and flower gardens."
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01790","I finished my basket research."
,"Now you should be able to carry more when you harvest."
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01791","I finished my hammer research."
,"Now if you find a boulder in your way, you can just smash it to bits! Think of the time you'll save!"
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01792","I've developed a new watering can."
,"Pouring water over a certain artifact found on expeditions reportedly promotes the growth of beasts in the area."
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01793","I finished my snack set research."
,"You can use it to carry around snacks while exploring, which will help stave off hunger."
,"You can view the completed item by selecting Items > Survival."
"#01794","I've developed new recycling technology."
,"It should allow us to <co=0070c0>recover some lumber</co> when demolishing buildings and such on <island>."
,"This should give us a bit more freedom in deciding what to build and when."
"#01795","I've completed a <co=0070c0>hot-air balloon</co> at last."
,"You've traveled around by raft until now..."
,"But now you can drift through the air in style."
,"Kind of romantic, don't you think?"
"#01796","I've finished my research into rearranging."
,"Now it'll be easier to move things that you've built."
,"Sometimes moving remodeled facilities will revert them to their original state, so be careful."
"#01797","I've finished researching bridges. Now we can build bridges over nearby waters and beaches."
,"It takes a lot of lumber, but it should make it easier for tourists to walk around the island."
"#01798","You know that old book I've been studying?"
,"It turned out to be a skill tome. Anyone who equips it can use the skill described in the book!"
,"It should prove useful in battle!"
"#01799","I finished researching how to build a clinic."
,"Building a clinic near beast or human residences will accelerate their recovery rate."
,"Faster recovery means faster harvesting as well."
"#01800","I finished my research on schools."
,"If you <co=0070c0>assign an instructor</co> to a school, any allies living adjacent to it will start attending."
,"They'll be able to earn EXP without leaving on expeditions!"
,"They can only progress up to the level of their instructor, but..."
,"It should still be helpful."
"#01801","Hello! This is a brand new amusement park!"
,"Battle fearsome beasts to win experience points!"
,"Have at it!"
"#01802","Not bad."
,"An even more challenging course awaits, however."
,"Best of luck."
"#01803","I must admit, you're quite impressive."
,"I've prepared one last course for you."
,"And some very special opponents."
,"Have at it!"
"#01804","Okay, okay! You win!"
,"I never thought you could beat a Wairobot this strong..."
,"But you've provided me a lot of excellent data to work with."
,"..."
"#01805","From now on, I will be known as Dr. Mochipon."
,"I'll be leaving on a rocket shortly to conquer the galaxy."
,"Thanks for all of your help!"
,"Goodbye!"
,"Oh, by the way, I'll keep the coliseum open, so feel free to come again!"
"#01806","Oho! I suspect this area will provide some inspiring ideas for research."
,"Perhaps some new research subjects will turn up."
,"Here, take these snacks and start exploring!"
"#01807","Thank you for your very generous investment!"
,"Thanks to you, I can now be mass-produced, so I plan to take a trip around the world!"

,"It must have been quite dangerous! I'd like to confer this award to commemorate the achievement."
,"Your award also comes with a cash prize. Use it well."

"#01821","I came to offer this award when I heard that you now have a building with an impressive nature level."

,"I look forward to seeing how richly your island's natural beauty flourishes in the days to come."
,"Your award also comes with a cash prize. Use it well."
"#01822","I hear that a certain intrepid explorer has <co=0070c0>conquered</co> new areas without halting and resuming later."

,"Your award also comes with a cash prize. Use it well."
"#01823","I heard that a certain brave adventurer managed to defeat a high-level beast."
,"Powerful beasts still roam the world. I wonder how you'll fare against them."
,"I look forward to finding out!"
,"Your award also comes with a cash prize. Use it well."
"#01824","Try building a <co=0070c0>home for your ally</co>."
"#01825","A human will be living here."
,"If there are trees or fields within the <co=0070c0>green border</co>, the occupant can harvest food there."
,"Try to place fields or lumber mills adjacent to houses."
"#01826","A beast will be living here."
,"Your allies are happiest when surrounded by nature."
,"So try to build them houses in places abundant in vegetation and other natural features."
,"You can choose a location while scrolling. Touch the building and drag to make fine adjustments."
"#01827","Fields are essential for harvesting food."
,"Placing them within the green border will have the biggest effect on food production."
"#01828","Planting woods or forests will improve the environment, speeding up your allies' recovery rate."
,"Try to plant them close to houses."
"#01829","Lumber mills are important for supplying lumber."
,"You will be able to build more as you play through the game."
"#01830","A facility that meets <co=0070c0>remodeling requirements</co> has appeared on <island>."
,"For details, select <co=0070c0>Info</co> > <co=0070c0>Remodeling</co>."
,"Some think that upgrading helps speed up recovery and harvesting work."
,"Try upgrading lots of different kinds of facilities."
"#01831","Uh-oh. One of your remodeled facilities has reverted to its original state."
,"It happens if you demolish a nearby facility that was required for the renovation."
,"Rebuild it and the facility will return to its remodeled state."
"#01832","Night has fallen."
,"Nocturnal beasts may appear."
"#01833","It's morning."
,"You might see some beasts that like this time of day."
"#01834","It's the first power generator on <island>!"
,"It's most effective if you place it near houses or pastures."
"#01835","That's a weapon or piece of armor for a beast to equip."
,"You can only equip one weapon, but can equip as many other kinds of equipment as you have slots."
"#01836","Here you select your main party members to take with you into combat."
,"It can be difficult to know whether to give priority to HP, attack power, or elemental alignment."
,"If you have three or more allies, you can press the <co=0070c0>left soft key to remove a member</co> from your party."
"#01837","Here you can see a list of your allies."
,"Select one to view detailed information or to change equipment."
"#01838","This is a list of allies that have been promoted to instructor."
,"Select an empty slot and you can enter a magic word, but..."
,"I wonder what that means..."
"#01839","This is a list of survival gear that should prove useful to island life."
,"If you find a lab, you'll be able to research new gear."
"#01840","Oh, dear. That impact broke your survival gear."
"#01841","Don't worry."
,"I can repair it when I get home."
"#01842","Allies wounded in the last battle are now <co=0070c0>recovering at home</co>."
,"They should recover on their own, given enough time."
,"But you can speed up the process by using recovery items."
"#01843","Select one from <co=0070c0>Items</co> > <co=0070c0>Supplies</co> to do so."
,"The environment around allies' houses can also affect their recovery speed."
,"In any case, I hope they get better soon."
"#01844","This is a first for <island>..."
,"A sightseeing ship has arrived!"
,"Let's hope our island develops into a hot spot that tourists stampede to someday!"
"#01845","Oh, they've developed a bond."
,"When three allies with the same traits team up, they fight <co=0070c0>more powerfully</co> than usual."
"#01846","Now that you have a wagon..."
,"You can swap party members in combat."
"#01847","Here we perform <co=0070c0>research</co> that will make life here on the island easier."
,"You can have any number of research projects going at once. Just ask me."
,"I'll just have some Red Banana energy drink and do my best!"
"#01848","Here you can make <co=0070c0>investments</co> to contribute to other islands' development."
,"As relations with these islands improve, more of their residents may visit us."
"#01849","You demolished a <co=0070c0>remodeled building</co>."
,"This reverts it to its <co=0070c0>original state</co>."
,"Refer to your remodeling guide and try remodeling it again!"
"#01850","Well done. <0> years have now passed."
,"This ends the first chapter of the game."
,"Your Clear Points will now be calculated."
"#01851","You have <0> total Clear Points."
,"Congratulations!<br>You got a new high score!"
,"Try to beat your score the next time you play!"
"#01852","You have <0> total Clear Points."
,"Too bad! You didn't beat your high score."
,"Try to beat your score the next time you play!"
"#01853","From this point on, your score will no longer affect your online ranking."
,"But you can keep playing for as long as you like!"
,"We hope you enjoy yourself!"
"#01854","Okay, we'll begin remodeling. I can't wait to see how it turns out!"
"#01855","You can appoint allies as instructors instead of dismissing them."
,"Instructors can no longer take part in exploration or harvesting."
,"But they'll provide other allies training and guidance."
"#01856","Make <0> an instructor?"
"#01857","We can't appoint any more instructors unless we dismiss someone first."
"#01858","<0> will become a full-time instructor."
,"I'm sure we can expect great accomplishments!"
"#01859","It seems that the <0> can now be upgraded."
"#01860","You got a play time bonus!"
,"You can receive a bonus of <co=0070c0>one medal</co> for every seven minutes played."
,"This doesn't include time spent with menus open or when the game is otherwise paused."
,"You can get a max of 10 medals each time. Try restarting the game once in a while to get a new bonus."
"#01861","Since we had an instructor with the exact same attributes, the slot was overwritten."
"#01862","No one can carry more than one weapon at a time."
,"Allies with more ""Rank"" stars can equip more gear."
,"Keep this in mind when choosing allies."
"#01863","Hello. I'm the head of the Deserted Island Association."
,"I travel from island to island, rewarding excellence when I find it."
,"I'm here today because you've qualified for an award."
,"I look forward to your future progress as well!"
"#01864","Oh, dear. The road to the shop I wanted to visit is cut off. It's a bit far away, it seems."
,"If you put shops <co=0070c0>near the dock</co>, more people could visit them..."
"#01865","Our allies have increased nicely."
,"If you find that some just aren't working out, you can release them back into the wild."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Allies</co> > <co=0070c0>Dismiss</co> to dismiss them."
,"Hopefully we won't need to do that very often."
"#01866","My, it looks like you've come across a stubborn obstacle..."
,"You won't be able to make it past this one with your current survival gear."
,"You might be able to if you <co=0070c0>level up</co> your gear under <co=0070c0>Items</co> > <co=0070c0>Survival</co>, though."
"#01867","You assigned <0> to the school."
"#01868","You now have a wagon."
,"If you want to <co=0070c0>expand it</co>, you can level it up by selecting it on the next screen."
,"This takes valuable medals, but allows you to <co=0070c0>bring more allies along</co>, making combat more fun."
"#01869","You are currently on another island. You need to <co=0070c0>return to <island></co> first."
"#01870","<0>'s rage has peaked and can be unleashed as an <co=0070c0>aura</co>!"
,"Doing so should boost its <co=0070c0>attack power</co>!"
"#01871","<0> has left a specialty at the nearby <1>."
,"When tourists visit <co=0070c0>shops with specialties</co>, they will spend more money than usual."
,"If there are <co=0070c0>people near a shop</co>, the number of specialties will increase, attracting more tourists."
"#01872","We were en route, but we'll head home for now."
"#01873","We've been away from <island> for a while now. Maybe we should head back home?"
"#01874","Here you can use skills."
,"The <co=0070c0>higher an ally's intelligence</co>, the more effective a skill will be."
,"Some allies will learn new skills when they gain a level."
"#01875","Heh. Welcome."
,"We recently got something very special in stock..."
,"A photo of me, signed and kissed by yours truly, for only $20 million!"
,"But alas, it just sold out. We do still have ""Create Transfer Data"" in stock, though."
,"It preserves your data at the time of purchase and allows you to transfer some of it into a new game."
,"It doesn't compare to that photo, but pick it up if it catches your interest."
"#01876","We got some new products in stock!"
"#01877","Heh. Thanks for your purchase!"
,"This product will remain in effect even if you select ""New Game."""
,"Thanks to your purchase, I'm one step closer to my dream of a career in politics."
,"Oh, needless to say, your new permit will take effect if you continue your current game as well."
"#01878","Hmm. I hear muttering on <island> about not being able to harvest."
,"If someone says, ""<co=0070c0>Can't harvest</co>,"" it means there are no fields or nature nearby."
,"Try to always place natural features near houses."
"#01879","Heh heh heh. So we meet again."
,"This time..."
,"I won't lose!"
"#01880","Ow ow ow!"
"#01881","Heh heh heh. I've made some improvements."
,"This time..."
,"I really won't lose!"
"#01882","Owie owie owie!"
"#01883","Heh heh heh. My design is now perfect!"
,"I promise you..."
,"I won't lose again!"
"#01884","We'll meet again!"
"#01885","You found me!"
"#01886","Guard the dish on my head at all costs!"
"#01887","An excellent choice."
,"This product can be purchased with actual money."
,"Children must have a parent or guardian's permission before making any purchases."
"#01888","Here you can see a list of any items that you've purchased."
,"Once you accept an item listed here, it will be reflected in the game."
"#01889","Thank you."
,"Medals are very valuable. But I've heard that there are places where you can buy them as well."
,"Be sure to come back when you discover new equipment."
"#01890","Heh. You've made a terrific choice."
,"You can now automate battle with Auto-Combat. It's useful against weak foes or when leveling up allies."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Allies</co> > <co=0070c0>Tactics</co> from the menu to issue commands."
"#01891","You've selected ""Auto-Combat."""
,"Starting with the next battle, allies will fight automatically (except in boss battles)."
,"You can issue individual commands at the next screen if necessary."
,"By the way, you can disable Auto-Combat by following the same steps."
"#01892","Ooh! <0> has entered a growth spurt phase."
,"It depends on the type of ally, but some will sometimes begin a growth spurt after gaining a level."
,"They should develop rapidly once they do!"
"#01893","Heh. This is a <co=0070c0>rare item</co> that allows an ally to equip more gear."
,"The store I opened has some wonderful products."
,"Contact me via <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Wairo Inc.</co> anytime."
"#01894","One of your allies has reached the maximum level of 20."
,"If we learn more about beasts, we might be able to raise their maximum level..."
"#01895","Of course!"
,"I'll get to work collecting information about beasts from around the world!"
,"This should help eliminate your level problems. Just give the word via ""<co=0070c0>Research</co>"" and I'll get started."
"#01896","I scoured the world's resources for information on beasts."
,"And we've successfully <co=0070c0>raised</co> <co=0070c0>the max level</co> your allies can attain!"
"#01897","You can upgrade this survival gear from the <co=0070c0>Items</co> > <co=0070c0>Survival</co> menu!"
,"It should help your adventures go more smoothly."
"#01898","Lately we're getting more opportunities to travel to distant places."
,"If we could mobilize more efficiently, expeditions would probably go smoothly as well."
"#01899","I've got it!"
,"I'll look into ways to make your departures smoother."
,"It should be useful for making lots of round trips. Just select ""<co=0070c0>Research</co>"" and I'll get right on it."
"#01900","While walking around the island, I discovered a wonderful way of walking."
,"It should help your allies <co=0070c0>mobilize for departure</co> quickly!"
"#01901","You've removed the ads from the game, plus you can now rotate your device to play in landscape mode!"
,"You can toggle the latter feature on or off in the Options menu."
,"Happy adventuring!"
"#01902","I've found plans for a cutting-edge flying machine."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Actions</co> > <co=0070c0>Research</co> from the menu and just give the word!"
"#01903","The new flying machine is now complete!"
,"Now you can move between islands in the fastest possible way!"
,"And its soft body is incredibly comfortable!"
"#01904","You can't claim those without exceeding the limit of <0> medals."
,"Once you've used some of your medals, come back to claim them via the <co=0070c0>Purchases</co> menu."
"#01905","Heh. Welcome back. Please, buy whatever you like."
"#01906","Unfortunately that item is <co=0070c0>sold out</co>. Please check out our other products."
"#01907","Oh, dear... I <co=0070c0>couldn't contact</co> HQ."
,"Come back to the shop after checking your signal and communications status."
,"I'm sure our usual selection of products will be available to you."
,"Now then..."
"#01908","Let's try making a dirt path."
,"Tap the place where you want it to start, then drag to make the path."
,"Tourists will walk along it, so lay it out nicely through the center of the island!"
"#01909","It's time to go exploring."
,"Scroll up and down to see relevant info I've prepared."
"#01910","Oh, you've already ordered a <0>."
,"It may take a little time to arrive, so why don't you go out exploring for a bit while you wait?"
"#01911","Oh, you've already got another <co=0070c0>product on order</co>."
,"It should arrive shortly, so <co=0070c0>please wait a few minutes</co> and try your order again."
"#01912","Heh. Thanks for your purchase!"
,"I saved some of your play data to be transferred over to your next game."
,"However, <co=ff0000>your medals won't be carried over</co>, so please use them up before starting a new game."
