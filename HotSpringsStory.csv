"#00388","The other day, a reader asked us what the secret to becoming a famous hot springs inn was. We decide to ask the same question to inns around the country. In the end, it seems that the best inns concentrate on their scenery.<br> <br>For example, planting Pine Trees near a bath can enhance its scenery and guests' satisfaction--and that leads to more money for you.<br>Remember, scenery is the first step on the road to becoming a famous inn."
"#00389","A member of our editorial staff recently visited a famous hot springs resort town to do some research. You might associate hot springs with old fashioned Japanese villages, but it actually had the best in modern facilities.<br> <br>After hearing that one inn in particular was the most successful, he went there and spoke with the owner. “It's good for everyone when the town develops,” said the owner. “It attracts new customers to the inn, so I'm happy to invest my own money on it.”<br>Indeed, people are more likely to visit an inn if there are many things to do in the surrounding areas. Perhaps investing in the development of the town would be a rewarding decision."

"#00391","According to a recent tip, <1> has run out of money. With no cash, all that's left to do is stay put in the guest room.

"#01374","Information"
"#01379","In this game, you take control of a Japanese hot springs inn. Build rooms and facilities to attract guests, topping the competition to become #1 in all of Japan! Read this guide carefully to maximize your experience!"
,"The default currency is set to ￥ (yen), but you can change it to ＄ (dollars) if you like. Do this by accessing the Menu, going to System, and opening up Options."
,"▼Game Flow<br>Make money by building facilities popular with certain guest types, or “targets”! Target preferences are largely based on gender, age, and profession. Don't worry, you'll naturally get a feel for it!"
,"Each time guests use your facilities, money will be beamed straight into your pocket! See the top right to view your funds. Use your hard-earned cash to then buy items, invest in projects to unlock targets, and even expand your land."
,"▼Guests<br>The more popular your inn is with certain targets, the more guests you'll have and the longer they'll stay. Aim for those coveted overnight stayers as they spend a ton more than day guests."
,"▼Guest Behavior<br>Guests first go to their room, then to the bath. After a good soak, they'll visit interesting stores nearby, returning to their room once their money is gone."
,"▼Targets<br>Guests you target are more likely to come to your inn. Specify targets by opening the Menu and going to Targets. Certain targets might help you out..."
,"▼Facilities (1)<br>■Popularity<br>Governs guests' satisfaction.<br>■Price<br>How much a facility costs to use."
,"▼Facilities (2)<br>■Scenery<br>Plants and other scenery nearby increase popularity and price of facilities. Try different combinations!"
,"▼Facilities (3)<br>■Compatibility<br>Gender and age bring about differences in preference, so make sure to cater to your clientele. Note that compatibility is affected by the surrounding facilities."
,"▼Bath Effects<br>Putting certain scenery or facilities near a bath boosts its scenery score, and can sometimes unlock special effects..."
,"▼Getting Items<br>Items can either be placed on the map or used on existing facilities. You can buy items, find them, or win them as prizes."
,"▼Item Effects<br>Some items will be more effective on certain facilities. When used, items affect all facilities of the same type."
,"▼Guidebooks<br>Guidebooks are published every September and March. These feature all the top-voted inns. Get a high rank to win a cash prize!"
,"▼Investing<br>Invest to unlock new targets, purchasable items, and facilities. You may even be able to invite some very special guests..."
,"▼Ending<br>The game ends in March of Year 16. Your money and points will then be saved to the high score, but you can keep playing as long as you like."
,"▼Other<br>Some game parameters will be carried over if you start a new game after reaching the end. Keep playing and you may meet some special guests..."
