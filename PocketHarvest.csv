"#01255","▼ Pocket Harvest<br>In this simulation game, you manage a farm where you raise virtual crops and livestock. Try to make your farm the biggest and best in the world."
,"▼ Game Flow<br>Plant new fields, train your workers and expand the size of your farm. After tourism facilities become available, you will also be able to invite guests to your farm."
,"▼ How to Farm<br>When you build a field in an empty lot, your workers will plant it. A little while after the field is seeded, you will be able to harvest crops. If your workers tend the field, the quality of the crops will increase."
,"▼ Fields 1<br>Fertility: This increases a crop's sales price, and can be boosted by a forest or other facilities nearby.<br>Quality: Can be improved by using items or through cultivation. May also be affected by the nearby environment..."
,"▼ Fields 2<br>Moisture: Affected by weather and the nearby environment. Each type of crop has an ideal moisture level. Some facilities also allow you to adjust moisture levels."
,"▼ Fields 3<br>Taste, Texture, Aroma, Appearance: These are important in contests and when trying to increase the quality of your crops. Crops that taste better will fetch a higher price."
,"▼ Cultivation<br>In addition to using items, your workers can try to increase the number of fields you can plant of a particular type of crop, or improve the crop itself. The more knowledge the worker has, the higher the chances of success."
,"▼ Changes in Season<br>Each crop has seasons it is best suited to and won't grow outside of those seasons (although they can still be harvested). Having a greenhouse nearby lets crops grow even out of season."
,"▼ Weather<br>Sunny: Crops grow quickly, but the fields dry out.<br>Rainy or Snowy: Crops grow more slowly, but fields get more moisture.<br>Cloudy: No change in moisture."
,"▼ Typhoons<br>If your farm gets hit by a typhoon, your produce can get completely blown away. But if you have insurance you can get at least some compensation for the damage."
,"▼ Increasing Crop Yield<br>You can use items or cultivation to boost crop yield, but planting the same kinds of crops next to each other also helps. Try planting in squares of 2x2 or 3x3, etc."
,"▼ Crop Components<br>Each crop has various components like vitamins and starch. Use a bio lab to extract these and you may be able to make items or specialties for the facilities on your farm."
,"▼ Insects<br>While insects can get in the way of harvesting crops, they can increase the yield of crops that are still growing. You can use items and certain facilities to get rid of insects."
,"▼ Farm Workers<br>Your workers live in houses on your farm and work tending the nearby fields. They can also move from one house to another. You can give them items and tools to boost their attributes and increase the amount they harvest."
,"▼ Worker Attributes<br>Stamina: When workers get tired, they will go home, but you can restore their stamina with a boxed lunch.<br>Knowledge: Boosts chances of successful cultivation.<br>Work: Boosts the produce that can be harvested at once."
,"▼ Boxed Lunches<br>When your workers get tired, they can eat a boxed lunch to regain their stamina and also get a boost to their attributes. Planting certain fields near one another can let you discover new types of lunches."
,"▼ Hiring Workers<br>You will periodically get applications from people who want to work at your farm. Having skilled staff members tends to attract more applicants."
,"▼ Tourists 1<br>As your farm's overall popularity and appeal increase, you will be visited by more and more tourists. And as you get more facilities, you will also be able to invite certain special guests."
,"▼ Tourists 2<br>The higher the attributes of the facilities that tourists visit, the more satisfied they will be. When tourists' satisfaction goes up, they will spend more money. Place crops that they like near the facilities to boost satisfaction."
,"▼ Research Points<br>Research Points are indicated by the light bulb icon in the upper right of the screen. They can be discovered when your staff works in the fields or via facilities, and are used for cultivation, to purchase tools, etc."
,"▼ Facilities 1<br>Facilities can be discovered on the map or developed through investments.<br>Popularity: This is added to the value for the farm as a whole, making it easier to attract tourists."
,"▼ Facilities 2<br>Appeal: Higher appeal makes it easier to satisfy visitors.<br>As you proceed in the game, you can also develop specialties using components extracted from your crops."
,"▼ Combos<br>Placing compatible facilities near each other creates combos that boost popularity, appeal, and fees, all of which should make managing your farm easier."
,"▼ Store Missions<br>Your farm will get a variety of missions from stores that want to develop new products. To complete a mission, you must grow the specified crops in fields near the store."
,"▼ Items<br>Using items on workers or crops can increase their attributes or quality. Developing a specialty at a store will increase the number of items that you can create."
,"▼ Farming Cards<br>Farming Cards have a variety of useful effects, such as accelerating a crop's harvest or boosting a field's moisture. You can get cards via events or create them using certain crop components."
,"▼ Crop Crazes<br>From time to time, certain crops may suddenly become popular, temporarily increasing their sales price. Using Farming Cards or moving skilled workers near the popular crop is a good strategy."
,"▼ Tours<br>Tours can be initiated from the ""Investments"" menu, and involve inviting a large number of tourists to your farm. The higher the popularity and appeal of the facilities tourists visit, the more satisfied they will be."
,"▼ Year-End Farm Rankings<br>At the end of each year, your farm will be ranked against others using a variety of statistics. To get high ratings in each category, you'll need to manage your farm in a well-balanced manner."
,"▼ Winning Contests<br>Once you decide which field you will be entering in a contest, try using Farming Cards on it or creating combos in the area. It's also important to move talented staff members nearby."
,"▼ Game Tips<br>Work on building more fields and cultivating your crops. Don't just build one kind of facility. Try building a number of different ones to discover good combinations."
,"▼ After the End<br>The game ""ends"" in the 4th month of the 16th game year, but you can keep playing for as long as you like. And you can carry over some of your data when starting a new game, making it easier to get a high score."
,"(About This Game)"
"#01256","Special Spring Issue"
"#01257","   Hello, everyone. This newsletter is for farmers by farmers, and contains all the latest farming news and info.<br>   This time we have some tricks and tips for maximizing your harvests. Did you know that planting the same crops next to one another helps increase the amount you can harvest? Give it a try.<br>   Finally, we're excited to announce that a new farm called ""<name>"" has opened in the area. Word has it that they have a talented advisor working with them, so we look forward to seeing how they progress.<br>   Until next time, keep on farming!"
"#01258","Try Cultivation"
"#01259","   Greetings! In this issue, we'll be tackling crop cultivation.<br>   Having trouble growing tasty produce? Your harvests are too small? Problems like these can often be solved with cultivation.<br>   It's easy. Select a field and then choose a worker to put in charge of the project. After that, it's all automatic. The results will depend on luck and the knowledge of your worker. Why don't you give it a try?"
"#01260","Hardworking Staff"
"#01261","   Word on the street is that <name> now has a very hardworking staff member.<br>   ""I guess I'm just the kind of person who can't rest unless my work is done--and done right,"" said the worker in question, eating a quick lunch with one hand while planting seeds with the other.<br>   A worker's ""Work"" attribute affects how fast they can get their job done, so if you're in a hurry, try moving a hardworking staff member near the fields."
"#01262","A Worker with Stamina"
"#01263","   We have just learned that <name> now has a staff member with impressive stamina.<br>   ""I've always been strong, but ever since I started working on the farm, my body's gotten crazy ripped. Just look at these abs! I could probably put out my own fitness DVD and make a fortune..."" said the worker, gazing off into the distance.<br>   The higher a worker's ""Stamina"" attribute, the longer they can keep working without going home to rest--a good choice when you really need a job done."
"#01264","An Intelligent Worker"
"#01265","   Our sources indicate that <name> now employs a very knowledgeable worker. We rushed to the farm to see what pearls of wisdom we could extract from this scholar.<br>   ""Oh, you can learn this stuff in school, I guess. But as for me, I just listen to the plants. They tell me what they need,"" the worker said, bending over to put an ear to the ground. However, we did glimpse a ""Farming for Beginners"" book in the worker's breast pocket...<br>   Workers with a high ""Knowledge"" attribute have a higher chance of successful cultivation, which can definitely come in handy."
"#01266","Farm Popularity"
"#01267","   Today, we spoke with Bull Johnson from the incredibly popular Feather Farms.<br>   ""Winning contests is the best shortcut to boosting your farm's popularity,"" said Johnson. ""Of course, it doesn't hurt to have an incredibly handsome owner,"" he added, smiling widely and placing another autographed photo on top of a large pile.<br>   Maybe <name> will try winning some contests as well. We can't wait to find out."
"#01268","First Expansion!"
"#01269","   We've just learned that <name> has fulfilled the conditions in the Almanac required to expand the size of the farm.<br>   ""They've been doing quite a good job, so it's really no surprise,"" said one neighbor matter-of-factly. Indeed, it seems that word of the farm's very capable management has spread throughout the region.<br>   ""I couldn't be happier,"" said the farm's owner with a smile. ""We're finally on our way!""<br>   We look forward to seeing what the future has in store for <name>."
"#01270","20th Anniversary"
"#01271","   Believe it or not, it's been 20 years since <name> tilled its first field. In those early days, it was nothing more than a few fields, but now it features all kinds of facilities and even plays host to a large number of tourists.<br>   When asked for comment, the owner said, ""We've only just begun. I look forward to working with you all long into the future!"" All visitors to the farm were given miniature radish key chains as souvenirs. And the farm received a gift from the Farming Co-op in honor of its achievement.<br>   With <name>'s dedication to farming and to pleasing their guests, the future looks very bright indeed."
"#01272","50th Anniversary"
"#01273","   Incredibly, 50 years have now passed since <name> broke ground for its first fields.<br>   What started as one farmer's dream to make tasty produce has morphed into a veritable agricultural wonderland visited by tourists from far and wide.<br>   During the 50th anniversary festivities, some people who visited the farm just after it originally opened were invited back as surprise guests. They had of course aged themselves, and were accompanied by their children and grandchildren.<br>   Being able to create a farm that three generations can enjoy is no small achievement. Kairosoft salutes you! Thanks for playing!"
"#01274","=#00002"
"#01275","   This just in: <name> has met the conditions in the Almanac for increasing in size.<br>   ""Great. Now we have to get out all the decorations and noisemakers again. And don't get me started on the banquet preparations..."" said one distracted-looking worker.<br>   We plan to keep a close eye on <name> in the future."
"#01276","=#00003"
"#01277","   <name> has fulfilled the Almanac's conditions for increasing in size yet again, making it an oversized presence in the entire region.<br>   ""They're already that big?"" said the owner of a nearby farm. ""I guess we'll be the ones playing catch-up from now on."" Shortly afterward, he could be seen sprinting between his fields as if intent on literally catching his rival.<br>   <name> has been growing by leaps and bounds, and shows no signs of stopping. We can't wait to see what happens next."
"#01278","=#00004"
"#01279","   Incredibly, <name> has once again met the Almanac's conditions for expansion, and it quite literally rises above the rest in sheer scale.<br>   We visited the farm for the first time in a while and found that while it has certainly grown busier, with many attractive tourist facilities, it still boasts the clean crisp air and refreshing natural beauty it always has.<br>   Perhaps this ability to coexist with nature is <name>'s true strength. <name> is growing by leaps and bounds, so who knows what the future holds?"
"#01280","=#00005"
"#01281","   We have just received the news that <name> has finally fulfilled the Almanac's conditions for becoming an Ultra Farm.<br>   With this, the farm has become perhaps the largest tourist farm in the world, and the news has sent shockwaves throughout the agricultural industry.<br>   ""We may be the biggest in the world,"" said the owner, ""but we still have a lot of issues to solve. I'm counting on all of my staff to help us make the farm even better in the years ahead."" Despite these sober words, we couldn't help but notice the owner doing a little victory dance afterward. Congratulations!"
"#01282","A New Lake"
"#01283","   <name> has just finished construction on a new lake, our sources say. Children and adults alike enjoyed the swan-shaped paddle boats, with many feeding the turtles and carp now living in the lake.<br>   We understand that the surface of the lake will freeze during the winter, making it possible to ice skate, which will give it a completely different kind of appeal.<br>   We can't help but wonder what <name> will add next."
"#01284","Hot Air Balloon Rides!"
"#01285","   We have just learned that a hot air balloon platform has been added to <name>. Nearby residents wasted no time in visiting the farm for a free ride.<br>   ""I've really been looking forward to this!"" cried one. ""Every day for the past month, I've been tying 50 balloons to my back to help me get ready for this moment. Blowing up those balloons every day sure was a pain!""<br>   With this unusual addition, <name> is sure to attract even more attention."
"#01286","=#00254"
"#01287","   A bird blind has just been added to <name>.<br>   Constructed to allow visitors to observe the many species of wild birds around the farm, the blind was soon filled with nature lovers. ""Listen to those birds. There's nothing like it. It's so beautiful,"" said one.<br>   Outside, a group of children imitated the birds using water-whistles. This facility is sure to boost <name>'s already impressive reputation as a haven for nature."
"#01288","=#00274"
"#01289","   <name> now features a new addition--a windmill! Set against the sprawling fields, the brick windmill seems to conjure up images of an exotic foreign country in the minds of the tourists visiting it.<br>   ""I heard they built a big windmill here, but I had no idea it was this big!"" said one elderly woman. ""Now I've really seen everything...""<br>   This new attraction is bound to bring even more tourists to <name>."
"#01290","Tractor"
"#01291","   <name> has a new tractor, and it's all anyone can talk about. Tourists have been flocking to the bright red piece of farming equipment ever since it started plowing the fields.<br>   ""You sure get a nice view from up here,"" said the driver bashfully while showing off some impressive tractoring skills.<br>   Having a tractor makes farming much more efficient, making it well worth the effort to get licenses for your workers."
"#01292","First License"
"#01293","   When we got word of a scooter zooming around the fields at <name>, we decided to stop by and see for ourselves.<br>   ""I'm like a leaf on the wind!"" the rider shouted ecstatically as he left his colleagues in the dust.<br>   As <name> has grown, some workers have grumbled about the travel time between the fields and their homes growing along with it. A driver's license could be the answer."
"#01294","Huge Tracts of Land!"
"#01295","   Business at <name> must be good, as they are already working on expanding the farm.<br>   ""We'll be building some tourist attractions over there,"" said the owner, looking at a large and as-yet undeveloped stretch of land. ""And that area over there is perfect for farming, so we'll plow more fields there.""<br>   As we looked into the owner's eyes, we could almost see the future of the farm stretching out in front of us. Make no mistake, <name> is a farm to watch."
"#01296","Impressively Large"
"#01297","   We've just learned that <name>, which has become one of the world's leading tourist farms, has now acquired all of the land available to it.<br>   ""We've got all the land we need,"" said the owner. ""Now it's just a matter of how we develop it. Fun fact: If you were to put all of our fields end-to-end...you'd have a really long field.""<br>   We congratulate them on their achievement, and look forward to seeing what they do with all that land."
"#01298","Delicious Veggies"
"#01299","   While <name> has always been known for quality produce, it seems they have achieved the coveted ""S"" rank at last.<br>   ""It wasn't easy, but we finally got that 'S'! For a long time, I thought 'A' was the best. That was the best grade in school, right? But nooo... They had to add a whole 'nother grade just for the heck of it! Not that I'm bitter...""<br>   Higher quality crops make it easier to win contests and sell for more money when harvested, so we encourage you to improve as much as you can."
"#01300","Staff Training"
"#01301","   Are you training your workers? You need to use cultivation if you want to plant more fields of a particular crop or improve the crop itself, and having skilled workers is the only way to succeed at cultivation.<br>   Your staff's skills will improve to some degree through their daily work on the farm, but using items can really speed up the process.<br>   If you want to become a truly world-class farm, you'll need to train some strong, hardworking staff members."
"#01302","Component Extraction"
"#01303","   The bio lab at <name> has succeeded in extracting components from a crop, we have just learned.<br>   Extracted components can be used to create items or specialties for your facilities, and these can make all the difference in how well your farm performs. The components that are extracted depend on the type of crop you use.<br>   Just remember that you can't sell any crops used by the bio lab, so be sure to keep some to sell at market."
"#01304","Getting New Workers"
"#01305","   Today, we spoke with agricultural analyst John Barleycorn about what it takes to get new staff members.<br>   ""We often pay too much attention to how big our farms are, but the fact is that training our existing workers is the best way to attract new ones!"" said Mr. Barleycorn while crunching a handful of his new brand of veggie chips.<br>   Indeed, if you want to find new workers, making sure your present workers are well trained and well treated sounds like good advice."
"#01306","Gone Fishin'"
"#01307","   It's not uncommon for some of the many tourists who visit <name> each day to go fishing in the river. But something like <0> is unheard of!<br>   ""I was trying to catch fish... I never expected to catch something like this! I hope the people here at the farm will be able to put it to good use,"" said the tourist, blushing slightly.<br>   Following tourists might not be a bad idea once in a while..."
"#01308","Crop Craze"
"#01309","   According to info we have just received, a TV show about <0> cuisine has sparked a nationwide craze for the crop. The product is flying off supermarket shelves, temporarily tripling market prices!"
"#01310","Anti-Craze"
"#01311","   According to info we have just received, a TV show about <0> cuisine has just reminded everyone how much they dislike the crop. ""I'm so over that stuff,"" said one housewife. ""I can't even stand to look at it!""<br>   As a result, market prices have temporarily decreased."

"#01553","Hello! I'll be serving as your agricultural advisor here on the farm."
,"I'm here to help you make <co=0000ff><name> </co>one of the best farms in the world!"
,"It may be small but I hear the soil is quite fertile. If you work hard, I'm sure you'll go far."
,"If you ever need help along the way, you can view ""System"" > ""<co=0000ff>Tutorial</co>"" at any time."
,"For now, let's try planting a field. Select ""<co=0000ff>Build</co>"" from the menu."
"#01554","Well done. <1> years have now passed. This part of the game is over."
,"Your Clear Points will now be calculated."
"#01555","Total Clear Points: <1>"
,"Congratulations! You got a new high score!"
,"Try to beat your score the next time you play!"
"#01556","Total Clear Points: <1>"
,"Aw, you didn't beat your high score."
,"Try to beat your score the next time you play!"
"#01557","After this, your funds won't count toward a high score."
,"But you can keep playing for as long as you like! Have fun!"
,"If you start the game again from the beginning, you can carry over some items and components."
"#01558","You don't have enough research points..."
"#01559","You're running low on funds... The farm's future may be in danger if things go on this way."
,"But don't worry. I'll see what I can do about finding a little extra funding. One moment."
"#01560","Sorry to keep you waiting, boss."
,"I just won <co=0000ff>150,000G</co> in prize money from a national bubble gum blowing contest!"
,"I was going to put it toward my dowry, but... Here. Put it to good use on the farm!"
"#01561","You don't have any items."
"#01562","Remove fields or facilities."
"#01563","Move fields and facilities that you've constructed."
,"Try out various arrangements to see what's most efficient!"
"#01564","A new facility is now complete!"
,"You can make your farm more appealing by increasing the number of its facilities."
"#01565","This is one of your workers. Tap again to see a detailed list of attributes."
"#01566","Uh-oh! We're in the red, boss!"
,"Try removing some facilities with high upkeep or dismissing some workers to cut costs."
"#01567","Too bad..."
,"Goodbye..."
"#01568","Too bad..."
,"There doesn't seem to be a path leading home... Goodbye."
"#01569","Thanks a million!"
,"I'm new to farming, but I'll do my best."
"#01570","Boss!"
,"The <co=0000ff><0> fields</co> seem to have the perfect amount of <co=0000ff>moisture</co>, so they're going to have a bumper crop!"
"#01571","Yay!"
,"We can now plant more <co=0000ff><0> </co>fields. That should help the farm."
"#01572","I'm afraid it was too much for me. I'm sorry. Next time, I'll get more sleep the night before."
"#01573","Hmm... The Almanac says that the success of cultivation depends a lot on a worker's know-how."
,"Why don't we try again with someone a bit more knowledgeable?"
"#01574","Hi! You've got some great facilities here at <co=0000ff><name></co>. I love them!"
,"I'm sure I'll be coming back from time to time."
"#01575","I've made arrangements for a tour with a neighborhood travel agency."
,"A bus full of tourists should be arriving at the farm soon."
"#01576","Our first tour was a success! I'm so relieved to hear that they liked the farm."
,"Tourists like facilities with high popularity and appeal. They may even give you presents!"
,"Try experimenting with different arrangements to boost popularity and appeal!"
"#01577","Oh, dear! There's a bug loose on the farm!"
,"Bugs take over fields and get in the workers' way. Select the bug and use an item to get rid of it!"
"#01578","Wow, you've fulfilled the requirements for purchasing land. Well done."
,"Now you just have to pay the cost and the land will be yours."
"#01579","Hello."
,"You're doing well. You've increased your number of regular customers and your farm's size."
,"In honor of <co=0000ff><name>'s</co> achievement, I'd like to present you with these seeds!"
"#01580","The year's almost over. At the end of each year, the national farm rankings are announced."
,"Ranking high enough can raise the farm's popularity--not to mention the price of your produce!"
,"Let's try to reach #1 in every ranking!"
,"I wonder how we did..."
"#01581","A tourist has arrived at <co=0000ff><name></co>!"
,"Tourists are a great secondary source of income for the farm."
,"Try to make the farm as appealing as possible to attract a lot of tourists."
"#01582","Select ""<co=0000ff>Strawberry Field</co>"" from the ""<co=0000ff>Crops</co>"" menu."
"#01583","The workers living on your farm will tend to your fields."
,"The closer their houses are to the fields, the more efficient it will be."
"#01584","Here you can build a house where a new worker can live."
,"Each worker has a limited range, so try to keep houses close to the fields."
"#01585","You've discovered a new <co=0000ff>combo</co>! Combos have positive effects on nearby fields and facilities."
,"Newly discovered combos will be added to the ""<co=0000ff>Combo Guide</co>"" under the ""Info"" menu."
"#01586","This combination of fields has revealed a new lunch recipe!"
,"Give a lunch to someone! That worker will then be able to recover stamina once without going home."
"#01587","Select tools on the worker info screen to make your workers more efficient."
"#01588","Hello."
,"I'm afraid there are no fields within my range..."
"#01589","Oops! You'd better either move that worker's house near some fields or build some fields closer by!"
,"Some types of tools will also boost a worker's movement range."
"#01590","You can't plant many more fields. Why not try using <co=0000ff>cultivation</co>?"
,"Select a field, then select ""<co=0000ff>Cultivation</co>"" to increase the number of fields you can plant of a crop."
"#01591","Boss, I found someone who wants to work at <co=0000ff><name></co>! Let's build a house and hire a new worker!"
"#01592","Hello."
,"I was drawn to the tranquil atmosphere of <co=0000ff><name></co>."
,"But now I see that you have some wonderful facilities, too! I'd love to look around!"
"#01593","Hello."
,"I'm taking a class in agriculture, but I grew up in the city, so I've had some trouble catching on."
,"I thought if I looked around <co=0000ff><name></co> it might help. Thanks!"
"#01594","Hello."
,"A friend recommended <co=0000ff><name></co> to me."
,"This farm sure has a lot of tourist attractions! I'm impressed!"
"#01595","Hello."
,"I came because I heard there were some shops here that use <co=0000ff><name></co> crops."
,"I was really impressed by the selection! I won't be going home until I've eaten my fill!"
"#01596","The crops were ruined, but at least the fields got plenty of moisture from the rain."
"#01597","The crops were ruined, but at least the fields got plenty of moisture from the snow."
"#01598","Hello. It's always a pleasure to deal with <co=0000ff><name></co>."
,"Sales have been going so well, we're thinking of opening store #<0>, but we're low on funds..."
,"If <co=0000ff><name></co> could build the store for us, it would be easier to complete our missions. Think it over."
"#01599","Unfortunately, we didn't complete the mission in time. But we can always try again!"
,"It might be a good idea to plant a lot of the crops required for the mission."
,"And you might consider moving some workers close to those fields, too."
"#01600","Greetings. I work at the juice shop nearby."
,"Unfortunately, I forgot to order enough fruit for our juice."
,"If I don't do something, I'll lose my job and never be able to afford a second smartphone."
,"So I was wondering... If I gave you this, would you mind planting some fruit fields near our shop?"
,"Please think it over."
"#01601","This sounds like a job for us!"
,"We need to plant some orange fields near the juice shop so we can complete this mission!"
"#01602","How do you do? I run the neighborhood deli, and I have a bit of a problem..."
,"You see, we're catering a large banquet soon, but we don't have enough vegetables..."
,"There are some potato fields next to the store. Can you tend to them and give us the results?"
,"I'll even pay your expenses for moving some of your workers near the fields."
"#01603","I guess we have no choice but to help them, especially since they're paying our moving expenses!"
,"Either move an existing house near the fields or hire a new employee, then accept the mission!"
"#01604","Hi. I run a rice ball shop nearby."
,"We make our own pickles, but we're running short on vegetables..."

"#01608","Hi. I run a nearby shop that specializes in jams and jellies."
,"I work hard every day developing new products, but I just can't seem to satisfy my customers."
,"Do you have any ingredients that I might be able to use? Here. Take this for your trouble."
"#01609","Hello. I run the mushroom house nearby."

,"Could you help, by any chance? Oh, and this is for you. Please take it."

"#01650","Whoa! You scared me! Boss, this guy appears to be the landowner. Let's ask him if we can buy it!"
"#01651","Well, I'm not doing anything special with the land, so I'm not averse to selling it."

"#01652","I guess he's not so bad after all. Try selecting the area to check out the details."

,"Turns out they were grown here! Please hire me so I can learn how you do it!"
"#01658","Hello."
,"I drink vegetable juice for my skin, but I want to raise my own veggies to get better quality."
,"I followed the books exactly, but it didn't work... So I figured I'd come see how the pros do it!"
"#01659","Hello."
,"Maybe it's because I dress so lightly, but I catch cold a lot. I think I need more vitamins."
,"The problem is, I hate veggies! Can you help me grow some veggies that I can eat?"
"#01660","Hello."
,"I recently retired from the ring, and I can't find another job where I can use my powerful body."
,"But I heard that farm work can be pretty tough. Would you mind giving me a chance?"
"#01661","Hello."
,"I want to start a restaurant specializing in sumo stew, but I want to grow all my own vegetables."
,"My coach said <co=0000ff><name></co> is the place to go to learn how to grow veggies. Please hire me!"
"#01662","Greetings."
,"I decided to leave my castle to find out how the delicious vegetables I eat are made."
,"It seems that you use a variety of tools. How quaint! You'll just have to tell me where to start..."
"#01663","Hello."
,"All the cool girls are starting their own gardens these days. That's what they said on TV, anyway!"
,"So I thought I'd better get some farming experience myself! I don't want to be left out!"
"#01664","Hello."
,"I used to be a pop singer, but now I don't know how I'll make a living..."
,"I thought I should learn how to grow my own food, so I can be self-sufficient. Can you help?"
"#01665","Hello."
,"I got tired of being a secretary. I grew some potatoes once as a kid, so I thought I'd try farming."
"#01666","Hello."
,"I'm supposed to take over the family produce shop someday, but I know nothing about vegetables."
,"I think I have to try growing them myself to really be able to tell the good from the bad!"
"#01667","Hello."
,"I just love farm equipment. When I see a thresher or a tractor, I just melt inside!"
,"Working on a farm would be my dream job. Please hire me!"
"#01668","Hello."
,"I was just passing by your farm and it looked interesting, so I thought I'd stop by."
,"I wouldn't mind working here if you have an opening. Let me know."
"#01669","Hello."
,"I've mastered every job I've ever had, but, with farming, you're at the mercy of the elements."
,"I'd like to start a new career here at <co=0000ff><name></co> if you'll have me."
"#01670","Hello."
,"I just love the style of your workers. Those work boots are sooo cute!"
,"If I worked at <co=0000ff><name></co>, maybe I could look as fashionable as them!"
"#01671","Hm?"
,"I got lost in the mountains and ended up here. I'm starving! I'd love to tuck into some veggies!"
,"Of course, I'd be happy to do some work in return. Just tell me what you need me to do."
"#01672","Hello."
,"I've been wanting to do some exercise to build up my strength, and a friend recommended farming."
,"I hope to train my lower body to get back to the way I used to look."
"#01673","Hello."
,"A fortuneteller told me that my lucky color was green, so naturally I've decided to start farming."
,"You seem to have some very talented workers at <co=0000ff><name></co>, so I thought I'd try here first. Thanks!"
"#01674","Hello."
,"My master told me I wasn't very good at using a scythe, and your workers seem very good at it."
,"I hope to steal some of their techniques, but don't worry. I won't let on that I'm a ninja..."
"#01675","Fantastic! Our farm just got much larger!"
,"Oh, somebody is here to see you."
"#01676","Crops that win contests will sell for more money, and the farm's popularity will also increase."
,"Winning contests is key if you want to get a good ranking at the end of the year."
,"Select ""Actions"" > ""<co=0000ff>Contests</co>"" from the menu to enter!"
"#01677","Hello. I'm from the bio lab."
,"We use the latest biotechnology to extract components from crops."
,"You can use those components to create your own items or specialties for different shops."
"#01678","Biotechnology? What'll they think of next?"
,"Let's try building a <co=0000ff>bio lab</co> next to some fields!"
,"Crops inside the displayed range of the bio lab will have components automatically extracted."
"#01679","Boss!"
,"It looks like we've fulfilled the conditions in the Almanac for increasing the size of our farm!"
"#01680","We're off to a great start! Keep up the good work!"
,"Let's see what the conditions for reaching the next rank are."
"#01681","Let's see what the conditions for reaching the next rank are."
"#01682","The farm sure has grown. I'm getting a little misty just thinking about it..."
,"And look! We've fulfilled the Almanac's conditions! We've gone up in rank again!"
"#01683","The farm is really growing nicely. Keep it up!"
,"Here's a little something to commemorate the occasion! Go on. Take it!"
"#01684","Am I imagining this or..."
,"Yes! We fulfilled the Almanac's conditions and I didn't even notice!  We've gone up in rank again!"
"#01685","Nicely done! Now we can work on getting even bigger!"
,"And please accept this small token of my esteem."
"#01686","The farm has been doing really well lately. In fact..."
,"Yes! We fulfilled the Almanac's conditions again! Our rank has gone up!"
"#01687","But we can't afford to get complacent! There's still room for this farm to grow, you know!"
,"Oh, and here's a little something from yours truly."
"#01688","<co=0000ff><name></co> has grown into a fine-looking farm! It stretches as far as the eye can see. In fact..."
,"Yes! We've fulfilled the Almanac's final conditions! I can't believe it!"
"#01689","I know this was always our goal, but it's amazing to think that we really did it!"
,"It's all thanks to you, boss. But there's still work to do, so let's get to it!"
,"Oh, and here's a little something from yours truly."
"#01690","Boss! This year's farm rankings have just been announced! I'm a little nervous..."
"#01691","Let's try to do even better next year!"
"#01692","We have to harvest the required number of oranges near the juice shop to complete the mission."
,"You might try moving some of the workers' houses close to the fields to speed things up."
,"And you could try using this item I bought recently. It speeds up the development of crops!"
"#01693","Hello."
,"A friend recommended <co=0000ff><name></co> to me, so I thought I'd stop by for a look and a bite."
"#01694","Hello."
,"I heard <co=0000ff><name></co> was a fun place, so I came to see for myself. It's bigger than I expected!"
,"I'm going to really enjoy myself today!"
"#01695","Winning contests, cultivating crops and using items will increase prices and the amount you make."
"#01696","Plant more fields to produce more crops. Train workers to increase how much they harvest at once."
"#01697","Build many tourism facilities and check the combo guide for good combos to boost your popularity."
,"Making specialties for a shop will also boost the shop's popularity."
"#01698","You can improve workers' attributes by using items or giving them tools."
"#01699","Wow. Our farm already has <co=0000ff><0> fields</co>! At this rate, we're going to be huge in no time!"
,"By the way, I found this envelope while cleaning one of the storage sheds. Guess what's inside!"
"#01700","With all of these tourist attractions, our farm is really starting to become popular!"
,"The local government has given us something to encourage us to develop the area even further."
"#01701","Your research points are getting low. Try planting fields or building facilities to find more."
,"By the way, I was reading an old copy of ""Amazing Farm Comics"" when I found this in the pages!"
"#01702","Hi. I heard you have an unmanned store that sells veggies."
,"That sounds like a great way to buy fresh veggies on the cheap!"
"#01703","Nice to meet you. I'm a consultant from Pumpkin Properties dot com."
,"I came here because I have a proposition for <co=0000ff><name></co>."
,"Have you considered turning your farm into a <co=0000ff>tourist attraction</co>?"
,"With your beautiful natural scenery and fresh produce, you have an 86% chance of success!"
,"Start by selecting ""<co=0000ff>Investments</co>"" from the menu. Then select the ""<co=0000ff>Tourism Pamphlets</co>"" investment."
"#01704","Excellent. We'll get the ball rolling on this investment right away. Just wait a bit."
"#01705","One of your crops has broken a sales price record."
,"Things like field fertility and worker attributes can affect the sales price of your crops."
"#01706","Hi. I saw an ad for <co=0000ff><name></co> the other day, so I had to stop by."
,"It's so peaceful and the air is so fresh. I love it! I plan to wander all over your farm today!"
"#01707","Hello. Your ""<co=0000ff><0></co>"" investment is now complete."
"#01708","Thanks to this investment, you can now build more farming facilities."
,"Try building them to boost your harvests. Good luck."
"#01709","Thanks to this investment, you can now build a new tourism facility."
,"It's a good way to boost your farm's popularity."
"#01710","Thanks to this investment, you now have some dynamite to destroy hills."
,"Show that hill who's boss!"
"#01711","Whew. Walking is tough in places with no path. It would be much easier if you'd build one!"
"#01712","I see. I can see how places without a path would tire you out and slow you down..."
,"Try selecting the ""<co=0000ff>Build</co>"" menu to build a path in this area!"
"#01713","Maybe it's all the sun we've had recently, but the fields are pretty dried out..."
,"This is a good time to use a <co=0000ff>Moist Card</co> to add a little moisture to your fields."
,"Tap the ""<co=0000ff>Items</co>"" button at the bottom left to select it!"
"#01714","Oh, dear. Now that it's fall, the <co=0000ff><0> </co>fields are no longer in season."
,"You can still harvest crops out of season, but new ones won't grow."
,"Not to worry! If you build a <co=0000ff>greenhouse</co>, crops in surrounding fields will grow even out of season!"
,"We just got permission to use greenhouses at the last town meeting, as luck would have it!"
"#01715","Now you need to select the worker in charge of cultivation and the method of cultivation to use."
,"The more knowledgeable the worker, the greater the chance of success!"
"#01716","If cultivation succeeds, it will power up all crops of that type on your farm!"
"#01717","You can use items to speed up a certain crop's harvest or adjust a field's moisture level."
"#01718","It looks like one of our visitors was satisfied with our farm!"
,"When tourists use facilities with high popularity or appeal, their satisfaction gauge will go up."
,"The more satisfied they are, the more money they'll spend!"
"#01719","You can use items to power up the crops in the fields you select."
"#01720","The amount you can harvest from a single field will increase."
"#01721","You'll need orange fields to complete the mission!"
,"Build some in the yellow box surrounding the juice shop."
"#01722","When you're finished, tap the juice shop and accept the mission."
"#01723","That was quite a shock. I guess typhoons can occur when it rains for a long time like that."
,"You can use this item to control the weather, by the way."
"#01724","That was a surprise. I heard this winter was going to be cold, but..."
,"You can use this item to control the weather, by the way."
"#01725","All righty, then! We'll do our best to win that contest!"
"#01726","We've harvested the crops for the contest..."
,"So let's head out!"
"#01727","Hello. <br><co=0000ff><name>'s</co> <0> shipment has placed in the top 30 nationwide!"
,"Congratulations! Please accept this small gift to commemorate your achievement."
"#01728","Hello. <br><name>'s <0> shipment has placed in the top 10 nationwide!"
,"Congratulations! Please accept this small gift to commemorate your achievement."
"#01729","Hello. <br><name>'s <0> shipment has placed number 1 nationwide!"
,"Congratulations! Please accept this small gift to commemorate your achievement."
"#01730","Too bad. Maybe you should try increasing the <co=0000ff>yield</co> of your fields."
,"Select a field to upgrade, then choose ""Cultivation"" > ""<co=0000ff>Upgrade Crop</co>"" from the menu."
,"If you succeed, it'll also be easier to complete missions!"
"#01731","Looks like the tour members have returned."
,"It looks like they found something while they were on the farm! Let's take a look!"
"#01732","Try using cultivation to boost the price of your crops."
"#01733","Try using cultivation or building facilities that boost harvest near your fields."
"#01734","Put compatible facilities near each other or use items to boost your farm's popularity."
"#01735","Try using items to improve your workers' attributes."
"#01736","You don't have any lunches to select. Try building various fields near a house to find new recipes."
"#01737","Here you can select lunches that workers can eat on their breaks... But you don't have any yet."
,"Try building various fields near a house to find new recipes."
"#01738","Hello. Thank you for inviting me here. I've been looking forward to it."
,"I guess I'll go ahead and take a look around, then..."
"#01739","<co=0000ff><name></co> is just fantastic! I'm very satisfied. Thanks so much!"
,"It isn't much, but please accept this small token from me."
"#01740","Hmm... I can't say I was entirely satisfied, but you're headed in the right direction."
,"Feel free to ask me back sometime in the future. Goodbye."
"#01741","Look, boss! A river! It's flowing right by here! We'll need a bridge to cross it smoothly."
,"Okay, I'll see what I can do about adding a research project that will allow us to build a bridge!"
"#01742","Hello. Thanks to you, we now have all the crops we requested! I'm truly grateful."
,"Our sales have gone up, and it's all because of <co=0000ff><name></co>!"
"#01743","Please accept this as a token of my gratitude!"
"#01744","Thanks for your help earlier!"
,"Now that our sales have improved, we're going to need more crops for our new product line."
,"If I gave you these seeds, would you be able to grow them for us?"
"#01745","Hi! It's me again!"
,"Our products are selling so well we're running out of ingredients! A good problem to have, I guess."
,"Could <co=0000ff><name></co> help us out again with a new mission? Please think it over."
"#01746","Select the field to use for the contest. Any of the fields with <co=0000ff>blue borders</co> are available!"
,"Tap the ""<co=0000ff>List</co>"" button (the left soft key) to compare stats."
,"Try to pick a field that will grow the tastiest crops!"
"#01747","Oh, the guest we invited is back! I hope everything was satisfactory..."
"#01748","It looks like we've managed to attract some people to <co=0000ff><name></co>!"
"#01749","Hey, what do you think about adding a facility like this? It came to me in the shower this morning!"
"#01750","Yes! I can finally start life as a farmer! I've been waiting so long for this!"
,"Thank you!"
"#01751","Thanks! I'll do my best to grow some tasty veggies for you!"
"#01752","Huh? You really want me?"
,"M-My hands are shaking, but maybe that'll help me spread the seeds. Thank you!"
"#01753","Thank you. I'll do my best to grow a lot of tasty crops for our customers!"
"#01754","Thank you so much! I'll work my hardest so I can send some money home to my family!"
"#01755","I'll be reading this old ""Introduction to Gardens"" book as I go."
,"Thank you."
"#01756","I never thought I'd be the one you'd choose... You'll regret this!"
,"Sniff! Goodbye...!"
"#01757","Ha ha ha. Nice one."
,"What? You're serious?! But I still have 60 years left on my mortgage! What am I going to do...?"
"#01758","It just so happens that I recently won a trip around the world, so the timing couldn't be better."
,"Now I can enjoy myself without worrying about my job. Farewell!"
"#01759","I guess it's time to advertise the farm so we can get more visitors."
,"Let's give this one our all!"
"#01760","Um... I'm a little tired. I'm sorry, but could you ask someone else this time?"
"#01761","You asked me to work last time. Sorry, but could you let me sit this one out?"
"#01762","Your workers' attributes will naturally increase as they work in the fields, but..."
,"You can also use items to give them a little boost!"
"#01763","When a worker's ""Work"" attribute increases, it boosts the amount that can be harvested at once!"
,"You should try giving your workers items as well to really give them an edge."
"#01764","Crops in fields surrounding a greenhouse will grow well."
,"Try to place greenhouses near fields with crops that are out of season."
"#01765","You can't add any more fields..."
,"You can either remove fields you've already planted or use cultivation to allow you to plant more."
"#01766","You can't build any more stores..."
"#01767","Hello. There's someone I would like to introduce to your farm, if you don't mind."
,"If they're satisfied, I'm sure they'll be able to help <co=0000ff><name></co> in some way."
,"I encourage you to invest in the project if you're interested."
"#01768","Hmm... I think creating that specialty gave me an inspiration for a new item!"
,"I have increased the items that you can create. Check it out!"
"#01769","So you've finally got some sprinklers! They'll be a big help for your dry fields!"
,"A drainage pump does the opposite, taking moisture away. Use them to adjust a field's moisture."
"#01770","We should be able to clear this one in no time!"
,"To hire more workers, you'll need to build a new house. Select ""<co=0000ff>House</co>"" from the ""Build"" menu."
"#01771","It's already summer. Keep in mind that depending on the season, some crops won't grow."
,"But look at those <co=0000ff>sunflowers</co>! They're blooming so much they give a bonus to nearby fields!"
,"Using the characteristics of each season is key if you want to farm with the big boys!"
,"By the way, I found these seeds in my pocket. Maybe you can use them?"
"#01772","It looks like the new land has <0> fields."
"#01773","Tap the left soft key labeled ""<co=0000ff>Items</co>"" to use a Farming Card."
"#01774","The harvest has started in that field!"
,"The price you get for harvested fruits and vegetables will vary depending on the environment."
,"As your workers' attributes increase, they will be able to harvest more crops at once."
"#01775","You don't have any work tools to equip."
,"Select ""Items"" > ""<co=0000ff>Buy Tools</co>"" to purchase some."
"#01776","Wow, thanks! Now I can tend fields that are farther away!"
"#01777","Wow, thanks! Now I can get to the fields faster!"
"#01778","Wow, thanks! Now I can harvest crops faster!"
"#01779","Greetings. I see that things are going well on your farm."
,"I am the chairman of the farming association. I'd like to help <co=0000ff><name></co> out..."
,"I think this Almanac might come in handy. Please take it!"
"#01780","If we fulfill these conditions, we'll get permission from the association to expand our farm!"
,"You can check them under ""<co=0066cc>Info</co>"" > ""<co=0066cc>Almanac</co>."""
,"Now let's see... Aha! First we should plant more fields, then train our staff to harvest more."
"#01781","The time has finally come for us to take on a mission. Let's show them what we're made of!"
,"...But I see we don't have any of the requested crops nearby."
,"First, you'll have to plant some fields of the requested crops."
"#01782","You don't have any of the requested crops nearby. Try planting some."
"#01783","Even if we accept the mission now, some of the crops won't grow in this season. What should we do?"
"#01784","We haven't had any tourists yet, but once the farm gets a little more famous I'm sure they'll come flocking!"
"#01785","The harvest is going well. And look! We got a present from the locals!"
,"They must have spent a long time on it."
"#01786","Hmm... I'm sure we can do it. Let's give it our best!"
"#01787","We made it into the rankings! You can see the various categories on the next screen."
,"Tap each one for detailed info."
"#01788","Let's keep up the good work next year, too!"
"#01789","By the way, a fan in the audience gave us a present!"
"#01790","There's an expanse of land in the area. We're still looking into the details!"
"#01791","We've got a fair amount of capital now. Maybe we should invest! We can try buying up nearby land!"
"#01792","The deadline for our mission has come..."
"#01793","Just remember that any crops sent to the lab don't get sold."
"#01794","It looks like one of our facilities isn't getting used much by tourists..."
,"We could try making a specialty to increase the facility's popularity and appeal!"
,"Select the facility and select ""<co=0000ff>Develop Specialty.</co>"" If you have the required components, that is."
"#01795","I was visiting a tourist attraction when I saw some produce I liked. I couldn't resist eating it!"
,"That really ""filled up my satisfaction gauge,"" as the kids say today..."
"#01796","Thanks to our recent contest win, more tourists should visit us for a while!"
"#01797","Your insurance application is complete."
,"For the next year, you will be compensated for any losses incurred by a single natural disaster."
"#01798","Hello. We've had many requests for insurance, so we've started a disaster insurance service."
,"It's a little expensive, but it will compensate you for typhoon or snow-related losses."
,"Please give it some thought."
"#01799","Excellent. We have about a thousand forms to fill out, but I'll take care of all that."
,"Just wait a bit."
"#01800","Hello! Your farm has impressed me more times than I can count! Actually, wait. It's 10."
,"Please accept this with my thanks! And keep up the good work!"
"#01801","That's kind of an odd mission, huh?"
,"You can try building a well nearby or using a Moist Card to adjust the moisture of the fields."
"#01802","That's kind of an odd mission, huh?"
,"Try building forests or flower fields near the fields to increase their fertility."
"#01803","That's kind of an odd mission, huh?"
,"If your crops' quality isn't high enough, try using items or cultivation before accepting the mission."
"#01804","We've already entered the contest! Now we just need to wait for the big day."
"#01805","The contest will start once this field has been harvested."
,"Try adjusting the environment around the field or using Farming Cards to improve your crops."
"#01806","Understood. We'll meet our guest with chilled champagne in a stretch limo..."
,"Er, I mean, we'll use the usual bus."
"#01807","Boss! We've got trouble! A typhoon is headed straight for the farm!"
"#01808","Oh, no! A blizzard is headed straight for our farm!"
"#01809","Lunch distributed. It should restore some much needed stamina to that worker."
,"A neighbor was saying that growing more crops can lead to the discovery of new lunch recipes."
"#01810","Hmm... We're going to need higher fertility than that to complete our mission."
,"Try building some forests or flower fields around the fields to boost their fertility."
"#01811","Hmm... We're going to need higher moisture than that if we're going to complete our mission..."
,"Try building a well near the fields or using a Moist Card to adjust the moisture level."
"#01812","Hmm... We're going to need higher quality than that to complete our mission."
,"Try using items or cultivation to boost crop quality."
"#01813","We finally did it. When I think about everything we've been through, I get a little misty..."
,"The lucky rabbit's foot I've had since I started working for you is practically bald from rubbing."
,"Wait a minute... This thing's a fake! It says, ""Made in China""! I guess it still worked, though..."
"#01814","Let's try to improve our rankings in the other categories by next year!"
"#01815","Our farm's popularity has really grown!"
,"Adding new facilities can really help boost our popularity."
,"And building facilities in particular combinations can create combos that give great bonuses!"
"#01816","Hello. I couldn't help but notice that you haven't used any items on me in a while..."
,"The better our skills, the better the farm's chance at higher rankings."
,"It may attract people who want to work with us on the farm, too!"
"#01817","Hello. After considerable deliberation..."
,"We've decided to upgrade this application to add new game elements and adjust the game balance."
,"The new version includes robots with cutting-edge technology, as well as changes to combo effects."
,"The combo guide has also changed, so be sure to give it a look."
,"We hope you'll continue to enjoy our game."
"#01818","Some new farming robots are available! They're totally cutting-edge!"
,"Robots can only perform certain specialized tasks, but they can be great for boosting efficiency."
,"Why not try investing in a robot house so you can buy some robots of your own?"
"#01819","Your investment now allows you to build a robot house."
,"Select ""<co=0000ff>Robot House</co>"" and purchase a robot."
"#01820","Beep beep..."
"#01821","According to the instruction manual, robots tend to break after about two years."
"#01822","Hmm... It seems our guest wasn't satisfied this time."
,"Invited guests tour the facilities that have the highest popularity and appeal."
,"You can increase a facility's popularity and appeal by creating a combos in the surrounding area."
,"Next time I'm sure we'll satisfy our guest!"
"#01823","Hello. We calculate the annual shipments of farms around the country and then rank them."
,"If you come high enough in the rankings, you can get a prize."
,"You can check your current rankings under ""Info"" > ""<co=0000ff>Overview</co>."""
"#01824","I see... We have to use items or cultivation to boost our harvest amount so we can come in #1!"
,"The more of each crop we can harvest, the higher our ranking at the end of the year will be."
"#01825","I'm afraid that robot just blew up. Just after the warranty expired, too..."
,"Select an empty robot house and purchase another robot."
"#01826","Hello. I've noticed that you haven't been sending crops to the bio lab recently."
,"A bio lab lets you extract components from crops for use in creating specialties or items."
,"We'll be waiting for some crops from <co=0000ff><name></co>!"
"#01827","<co=0000ff><name></co> certainly has grown!"
,"Perhaps you'd like to try creating a combo like this in your empty lots?"
