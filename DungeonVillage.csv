"#00702","Screech! Whirr! Clank!"
,"When I heard my friends were defeated by the adventurers here, I just had to come!"
,"Can you defeat someone with a high-tech body like me?"
"#00703","Hello."
,"This town is perfect for training! I love it!"
,"I can't think of anywhere else I'd like to live. Please build me a house!"
"#00704","Hello."
,"I finally found the town that's perfect for me! This is it!"
,"I'd love to move here, so please build me a house."
"#00705","Hello."
,"I can learn so much by watching the adventurers in this town."
,"That's why I've decided to live here. Could you build me a house?"
"#00706","Hello."
,"This town surprised me. I never thought I'd find so many unusual items and equipment here..."
,"I'd like to choose this town for my training. Please build me a house!"
"#00707","Hello."
,"What an amazing town. I've never found a town with so many fearsome foes nearby."
,"I think it's perfect for making my name as an adventurer. I'd love to live here, so please build me a house!"
"#00708","Hello."
,"When I'm not out fighting, I like to shop in town and go to cafes."
,"I'd like to stay here for a long time, so would you consider building me a house?"
"#00709","Hello."
,"I love this town. You can get so many types of equipment and items here. I love it."
,"If I lived here, I'd have the first shot at all the rarest items. Could you build me a house?"
"#00710","Hello."
,"This town is the best! I can get any kind of equipment I need!"
,"I would love to live here, if you could build me a house!"
"#00711","Hello."
,"This town is fantastic. Everything is of the highest quality."
,"If you could build me a house, I'd be happy to move in."
"#00712","Hello."
,"My study of magic has been going wonderfully here. I think this town is a perfect fit for me."
,"I'd love to keep practicing my spells here, if you could build me a house."
"#00713","Hello."
,"The people of this town are so kind. I've really enjoyed myself."
,"I'd love to be able to live here. Could you build me a house, by any chance?"
"#00714","Hello."
,"This is a wonderful town! Being able to use so many different weapons is opening up new worlds for me."
,"But if I lived here, I think I'd be able to achieve even more. Do you think you could build me a house?"
"#00715","Hello."
,"I've never seen such a challenging town. Finally, somewhere that's a match for me."
,"If I lived here, I'd be able to fight these monsters every day! How about building me a house?"
"#00716","Hello."
,"The air is so nice and clean here. I love it. I can breathe clearly, even through my mask."
,"I'd like to start a mask-lovers club here in town, if you'd be willing to build me a house."
"#00717","Ni hao."
,"I've seen all sorts of towns, but this is the one that I've been looking for."
,"I'd like to move here. If you'd be willing to build me a house, that is."
"#00718","Hello."
,"I just love this town. There are so many wonderful shops!"
,"Can you make me a wonderful house to go with them?"
"#00719","Greetings!"
,"There are so many interesting people here. I feel like I can learn new moves just by being here."
,"I love to have my imagination stimulated like this. If you could build me a house, I'd move right in."
"#00720","Hello."
,"I think this town can really bring out my hidden talents!"
,"I'd love to live here, if someone would only build me a house..."
"#00721","Heh heh."
,"I love it here. Where else can I find so many rare and valuable products?"
,"I'd like to make this my base of operations, so would you mind building me a house?"
"#00722","Hello."
,"This town has the best equipment and the fiercest enemies. It's perfect for training!"
,"I'd like to live here so I can train full time. Could you build me a house, by any chance?"
"#00723","Ahem..."
,"It seems that I've finally found a place that will let me test my skills."
,"I want to keep refining my magic, so would you build me a house? I can live another 100 years or so..."
"#00724","Hello!"
,"Yes, this is a fantastic town. Much more fun than the castle, and better exercise, too."
,"I'd like to have a vacation home here, if you don't mind."
"#00725","Greetings!"
,"Every day I spend in this town has been thrilling!"
,"Would you mind building me a vacation home here?"
"#00726","These are your facility sales for one month."
"#00727","This is the number of facilities in town."
"#00728","This is the number of adventurers living in <0>."
"#00729","You need to build the specified facilities in town."
"#00730","This is the number of quests you've cleared."
"#00731","This is the town's Popularity."
,"Raise it by building facilities and satisfying adventurers."
"#00732","This is the number of events you've held."
"#00733","Hello."
,"You've no doubt heard of my exploits, but let me warn you: I'm even stronger than the stories say."
,"Allow me to demonstrate..."
"#00734","Hello."
,"When I heard that someone in this town had been bullying my brother,<br>I came right away."
,"I'm going to return my brother's suffering a hundredfold!"
,"...You should probably get the first-aid kit ready."
"#00735","Hello."
,"So this is the town that's caused my brothers and sisters so much<br>trouble."
,"I'm a lot stronger than them, so prepare yourselves!"
"#00736","Hello."
,"When we heard of  my brothers' defeat, my mother told me to<br>come and see for myself."
,"You don't look very strong. So I'll try not to hurt you too much."
"#00737","So you're the ones who've been bullying my precious children?!"
,"You should know better than to make a mother angry!"
,"Time for a spanking!"
"#00738","I never thought my turn would come..."
,"My family has never been humiliated like this."
,"I had to rush back from a business trip in Kuala Lumpur because of<br>you!"
,"I have to admit, you've got skills. However..."
,"Playtime is now over! I'll send you all to the next world!"
"#00739","What?! Our funds have dipped into the negative..."
,"It just so happens that I have 3,000G saved in this lockbox, but please use it wisely..."
,"You can get more money by selling items in the shop or using items on facilities to boost sales."
,"Well, good luck!"
"#00740","The quest was canceled. Too bad..."
,"Why not train some adventurers and try again later."
,"To strengthen adventurers, try holding events or giving them new equipment."
"#00741","At the moment, there are <1> shops in <0>."
,"The more shops you have, the more popular the town will become."
,"Even building several shops of the same type can help boost Popularity."
"#00742","Your funds are in the negative..."
,"Try selling some items to make more money."
"#00743","Heh. It's been a long time."
,"Our family has used those bitter experiences to start a new life!"
,"We've been eating protein pudding every day to help strengthen our bodies!"
,"We're much stronger than before, make no mistake!"
,"We'll beat you this time for sure!"
"#00744","We've been working hard to improve ourselves..."
,"But I think we have reached our limit."
,"Still, we'll keep fighting!"
,"As long as our family--and Kairosoft--remains."
"#00745","We're back, and we've brought more friends!"
,"We won't lose this time!"
"#00746","Yes!"
,"There's lots of treasure in this dungeon! This is so much fun!"
"#00747","Wh-What?!"
,"I've never seen so much treasure! I thought about sleeping through this one, but I'm glad I came!"
"#00748","Wow!"
,"This dungeon is filled to the brim with monsters! We need reinforcements!"
"#00749","Wh-What?!"
,"There're so many monsters! That must mean they're guarding some amazing treasure! How exciting!"
