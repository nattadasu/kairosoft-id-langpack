"#01086","Every station has many routes flowing through it, and when a customer decides they want to go somewhere, be it near or far, they need a ticket. The vast wealth of possible destinations they could choose to visit is the reason why ticket prices vary.<br><br>We asked a well-traveled pilot what she thought about this, and she explained, ""Well, sometimes I want to go to a lovely hot spring, high up in the mountains. But on other days, I just need to go to the local airport. My destination is different every day, and so is the train fare!""<br><br>Reading a strategy guide, she continues enthusiastically, ""Of course the fare goes up a little when the station facilities improve, that's no surprise. I also understand that the ticket price can vary depending on which routes run through the station. Plus, it's only natural to be charged more to ride nicer trains. I also heard that the fare can be unintentionally raised if certain researchers work for the station...""<br><br>As she prepares her plane for take off, she shouts down some parting words, ""Maybe you could try using these tactics in my game, too!""<br><br>Well you heard it here first, maybe everybody should try and improve their station facilities!<br><br>That's it for this issue of the Off-the-Rails newsletter!

There are many of these nice stations being built right now, so I'm very happy!""<br><br>He continued, ""Also, did you know that customers walk faster in their favorite season? And they will be easier to keep happy during that time too!""

"#01090","Last issue we reported on the reasons why customers go home. This time we have found some research results and have an extended feature on what customers really feel when they use a facility.<br><br>In an exclusive interview, a professor familiar with customer trends spoke to Off-the-Rails. He said, ""First of all, the key factor that decides if a customer alights at a certain station is the quality and number of their favorite type of facility.""<br><br>He continued, ""Secondly, customers like to use facilities that are near to them... The further a customer has to walk to get to a facility, the faster their energy will deplete, so having an easy to navigate station layout is essential! Why? Well, you see, customers will use various facilities and wander about until they run out of either gold or energy. When customer leaves a station, they can contribute to the town's population. But, customers that come from the town to go elsewhere get on the train without using any facilities.""<br><br>The professor, who occasionally stopped talking to check his hair for lice, had been playing a racing game for the majority of the interview. At one point he looked up from his game and declared, ""Aha! Sometimes you DO need to throw banana skins on the floor!""<br><br>On this note we bade goodbye to the professor, but we should all take advantage of his tips on station management and look carefully at the movement of our customers!<br><br>That's it for this issue of the Off-the-Rails newsletter!

In the fierce race to be the best, it's only natural that a station with such a big lead would be guarded in their comments... What an intense experience of the fickle knife-edge that is success!<br><br>While the pair sat tight-lipped, we read these secret tactics from their fixed and stony glares.<br>- If you have many facilities, more people will visit your station.<br>- If the quality of your facilities is high, more people will come to your station.<br>The pair were able to confirm that this is in fact true, and a station abundant with high-quality facilities will attract more customers.<br><br>After a long, awkward silence, the pair had one final comment for us, ""Although I won't say anything about station management, one thing I will say is: if you happen to come across a game where I feature as a swashbuckling pirate, you should try it!"" For some reason they then gave us a specially-made lanyard depicting why Kairobot is amazing.<br><br>Everybody please be aware, although you may imagine Blacky Sheep to be a cute and fluffy farmyard animal, he's actually a man, so please don't be disappointed!<br><br>That's it for this issue of the Off-the-Rails newsletter!

"#01138","The other day, Off-the-Rails reporters witnessed customers rushing somewhere at a quickened pace. Naturally, we immediately headed off to find out just where the heck these people were going! Of course they were hurrying toward <station> Station!<br><br>We managed to catch up with one of these people, and it just so happened to be the chairman of the National Train Association! With a snort he said in a hoarse voice, ""I have always wanted to visit this station, and seeing as there's so much attention focused on it at the moment, this seemed as good a time as any. I just can't help but ride this wave!""<br><br>This up-and-coming station is obviously enjoying the benefits of this upturn, but perhaps they are intending to use this boom as a foothold to become a truly household name. The day when <station> Station breaks into first place in the yearly ranking must not be far away! I'm so confident that I've already written an article on it and sent it to Magazine Mogul's head publication office!<br><br>That's it for this issue of the Off-the-Rails newsletter!

"#01140","It has been pointed out to Off-the-Rails that for some reason even the most safety-conscious and large-scale stations seem to have limited access to facilities. The station that we have investigated and found to be a culprit of this is <station> Station!<br><br>Sensing the gravity of the situation, the assistant station manger of <station> Station responded to our reporters with sharp wit and acute insight, saying, ""We will bear in mind the ease of use of our station from now on. If a customer can't access a facility, their abilities decrease considerably. So, of course, fixing this problem would be advantageous for the station. We are going to be taking more care about this in the future, so please don't be too mean in your article!""<br><br>As she returned to her seat on the train, she left us with this comment, ""We will endeavor to bear in mind that putting potted plants and other decorative foliage in front of facilities is an annoyance and makes the installation hard to use. Also, you should definitely play other games that I appear in!""<br><br>As I sat and ate some delicious candy from the Bonbon Cakery, I became confident that <station> Station will keep the spirit of hospitality and station layout at the front of their mind in future.<br><br>That's it for this issue of the Off-the-Rails newsletter!

,"Let's work hard to make this station the best in the land!<br>Of course, I'll help you out in any way I can!"
,"If you don't understand anything about the game, please look at the Help section!"
,"Let's get straight to it!<br>To make our station amazing, we should improve the station's facilities."
,"Select <co=0070c0>Build</co> from the <co=0070c0>Menu </co>and try installing something like a facility."
"#01748","Oh, wow..."
,"You have successfully completed today's mission!"
"#01749","Ohohohoho! Amazing...<br>It's inspiring to see you work so hard!"
,"You can complete up to 3 missions a day, so why don't you try doing another one?"
"#01750","Construction of an additional floor has begun. Please be patient while it is being built."
"#01751","Why don't you install this on the second floor or higher?"
"#01752","Hmmm, you don't have enough coins for that..."
"#01753","Hmmm, you don't have enough gold for that..."
"#01754","Hmmm, you don't have enough <pic=lamp> for that..."
"#01755","It looks like you have used up your stock of that item."
"#01756","If you keep developing your station, maybe you'll find something nice..."
"#01757","You can't add any more platforms!"
,"Maybe you'll be able to expand some more if you unlock a new route."
"#01758","It seems there are no more potential researchers."
,"If you level up the customers, maybe some will become available."
"#01759","Level cap raised!"
"#01760","You can't select that...yet."
"#01761","You don't have any free space in your depot. Try combining some trains to free up some space."
"#01762","Your researcher has done a great job!<br>Now all you have to do is wait for the mail."
"#01763","<0> has departed amicably."
"#01764","Your research is complete!<br>Now all you have to do is wait for the mail."
"#01765","Let's try setting an item."
"#01766","The item slots are full..."
"#01767","You have to use this item on a facility..."
,"I hear that the facility that this item is attached to will attract more customers for one month."
,"Now choose somewhere to put it."
"#01768","Ooo, I can't wait to see what it does!"
"#01769","You have to use this item on a facility..."
,"The facility that this item is equipped to won't run out of stock, or close for cleaning, for one month."
,"Now choose somewhere to put it."
"#01770","You have to use this item on a facility..."
,"Facilities with this item equipped will find it easier to make customers happy for a month."
,"It will level up more quickly, and you'll obtain more <pic=lamp>."
,"Now choose somewhere to put it."
"#01771","There aren't any more facilities you can acquire right now..."
"#01772","This item will affect <co=0070c0>the whole floor</co>."
,"Which floor do you want to use this on?"
"#01773","Who do you want to use this on?"
"#01774","Which facility do you want to use this on?"
"#01775","Let's start developing this station!"
,"Which facility are you going to install? I'd suggest a <co=0070c0>Destination Guide</co>."
"#01776","The facility has been successfully installed!"
,"Let's keep building more facilities and make this the best station ever!"
"#01777","Oh?<br>It appears you need a tenant to move into this facility."
,"The application deadline for potential tenants has ended so..."
,"Let's tap the facility right away and see what we got!"
"#01778","There wasn't much of a buzz about this... The application list is pretty short, as you'll see."
,"Anyway...<br>Let's choose the person from the<co=366092> <co=0070c0>company in the top row</co> this time."
"#01779","Huh? Have I said that before?"
"#01780","Please select which <co=0070c0>end of the platform<co=366092> </co>you wish to extend."
"#01781","Hello!<br>Thanks to our hard work..."
,"The construction of your extension is finished!"
"#01782","Building more floor space is essential for <co=0070c0>expansion of the station building</co>!"
,"Platform or floor space... How should we expand?"
,"Well, let's try and not stress too much over choosing."
,"But... platform or floor space... I wonder which would really be better?"
"#01783","Hello!<br>Thanks to our hard work..."
,"The construction of your expansion is finished!"
"#01784","The construction of new floors... Now that's important for the further development of the station building."
,"Choose where you wish to build."
"#01785","Construction of the new floor is finished!"
"#01786","This is where you can lengthen, reshuffle, and organize your trains."
,"Customers with a higher <co=0070c0>compatibility score</co> are more likely to visit your station."
,"First, let's see how easy it is to add a car to the train."
,"Tap the blue box, and then tap <co=0070c0>the car of your choice at the bottom of the screen</co>."
"#01787","You can reshuffle a selected car by tapping it. Let's try swapping the <co=0070c0>blue box</co> for a car."
,"Next time you want to edit your train, <co=0070c0>tap any car</co> at the bottom of the screen to replace the current selection."
"#01788","That's quite a train you've made!"
,"Now if we arrange it like this... Yes, try making a train using only one color of car."
"#01789","This is where you can <co=0070c0>change the routes</co> that run through your station."
,"This has an effect on the type and number of customers who visit your station. But..."
,"...Maybe you should see the difference for yourself by switching a route."
,"I wear different shoes of the same color every day of the week... Have you noticed?"
,"Anyway, please confirm your choice of routes."
"#01790","OK, the route's been changed! I really do think that there will be a change in the customer base!"
"#01791","Let's look at doing some research!"
,"Maybe there's a new type of <co=0070c0>train</co> or <co=0070c0>facility</co> waiting to be unlocked..."
,"Before we can unlock anything, we need to hire a researcher!"
"#01792","Let's pick a researcher."
"#01793","Now, what should we research?"
"#01794","Oooh, a new train!"
"#01795","Oooh, a new facility!"
"#01796","Oooh, a new infrastructure upgrade!"
"#01797","So you want to level up your researcher?"
,"Using items on a researcher will help their <co=0070c0>special skill</co> to improve."
,"If you have spare items, you should be using them on your researchers."
"#01798","You can switch your researchers here."
"#01799","This is your mail box."
,"Important mail such as news and research results will come here.<br>Make sure to check it regularly!"
,"Go ahead, check your mail!"
"#01800","This is where you can check the status of your customers in more detail."
,"Currently there are two target customers."
,"I wonder if the types of customer we target has an effect on the types of customer we see in the station..."
,"Let's<co=0070c0> assign somebody</co> to the <co=0070c0>empty slot</co>!"
"#01801","Pick somebody to be the new target!"
"#01802","Welcome."
"#01803","Heh heh heh... Welcome, welcome, welcome..."
"#01804","You know, if you <co=0070c0>install our app</co>, Kairo Club, and then download the apps recommended there..."
,"...maybe you'll get some free coins."
,"Why not try it out? You're always welcome in the Kairo Club!"
"#01805","From now on you can use services from the Kairo Club app."
,"If you install Kairo Club, you can get extra bonuses!"
,"Why not go and take a look? You're always welcome in the Kairo Club!"
"#01806","Here you can take a look at the list of customers you can cater to."
,"It will help rekindle memories of all the people passing through our station!"
,"Try and get to know everybody!"
"#01807","This is where you can check the details of all the trains you have obtained."
,"Why don't you try looking at one of your favorite trains?"
"#01808","Welcome to the item box! Thanks for checking it out!"
,"Try using an item, you might just find that some are unexpectedly useful!"
,"Talking of items, I saw a smartphone I liked yesterday and bought it!"
,"But, it turned out to be a TV... I wondered why it was so big! Heehee!"
,"Anyway, make good use of your items!"
"#01809","Here is the earnings report for the year, split into monthly takings. I hope you can understand it."
,"I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon. Let's get those earnings up!"
"#01810","What is it?"
,"You want to place higher in the yearly rankings?"
,"Me too! I'll work super hard and try to help you as much as I can! Let's make next year the best it can be!"
,"Oh, but, now that a year has passed, you can start to develop another town..."
,"Which town will you work on this year?<br>Choose whichever one you want!"
"#01811","Look! Look! Look!"
,"Customers have used one of your facilities sooo much that..."
,"...it's given you a prize!"
,"Quick, tap it!"
"#01812","Oh..."
"#01813","It's time to collect your <pic=lamp>!<br>For some reason, everybody seemed reluctant to part with them..."
,"<pic=lamp> will be collected once a day."
"#01814","It's time to collect your usage fees!<br>For some reason, it felt like nobody wanted to part with their gold..."
,"Usage fees will be collected twice a day."
"#01815","It's time to collect your rent!<br>For some reason, it felt like nobody wanted to part with their gold..."
,"Rent will be collected once a day."
"#01816","Heh heh heh... You do have a discerning eye, don't you..."
,"By playing with ads for 24 hours..."
,"...you'll earn some free coins!<br>You know you want to... Heh heh heh."
,"So, why not turn on advertisements in the settings..."
"#01817","Apparently if you review this game, you'll get the chance to earn coins!"
,"You should definitely give it a go!"
,"Go on! I'll wait here."
"#01818","It looks like there isn't anywhere you can extend to at the moment."
,"So let's build this station as tall as we can!"
"#01819","It looks like there isn't anywhere you can expand to at the moment."
,"So let's build this station as tall as we can!"
"#01820","This is <co=ff0000>demolish mode</co>."
,"If you have a facility you wish to remove, try tapping it."
"#01821","These are special facilities that are quite a bit bigger than the normal ones."
,"They need a lot of space, but are well worth installing if you have them available!"
"#01822","Place the installation on a bright space on the platform."
"#01823","This facility requires 4 squares.<br>It uses a little more space, but it also attracts more customers."
,"Let's try installing it right away!"
"#01824","You can now construct an atrium on the 2nd floor and above."
,"Because customers can't reach some places, please think carefully about where you build your atrium."
,"By the way, you can get rid of an Atrium by building another Atrium on top of it."
"#01825","It's finally time to install some stairs!"
,"Remember, stairs require <co=0070c0>six squares</co> on <co=0070c0>both floors</co>."
,"It's difficult to get used to, isn't it...<br>Well, your management's been fine so far, so I'm sure it'll be OK!"
,"Use the <co=0070c0>floor display buttons</co> in the top right, and find a place to install them."
"#01826","It's finally time to install some escalators!"
,"Escalators are more compact than stairs, but they still require a large space on both floors."
,"Make use of the floor display buttons in the top right, and find a place to install the escalators."
"#01827","It's finally time to install an elevator!"
,"You need somewhere with space in the same place on both floors. After you've found such a place, try installing one."
,"Did you know you can build another elevator <co=0070c0>above or below</co> one you've already installed?"
"#01828","The yearly rankings have come around again..."
,"Which town do you want to develop this time?"
"#01829","That facility doesn't work well on floor space, it's not a good match at all."
,"Try placing it on a platform instead!"
"#01830","That facility doesn't work well on a platform, it's not a good match at all."
,"Try placing it on floor space instead!"
"#01831","OH!"
,"You have been developing your station so much..."
,"...you're now able to enter frenzy mode!"
,"It's a chance to get a lot more customers into your station!<br>Let's wait for a good time to activate it."
"#01832","It's finally time for frenzy mode!"
,"While frenzy mode is active, it'll be easier to make customers happy, meaning you'll earn more <pic=lamp>!"
,"Enjoy!"
"#01833","Goodbye researcher... Have a nice life!"
,"By the way, since they're gone, their special skill no longer applies, so please keep your wits about you!"
,"Right, what shall we do now?"
"#01834","I think if you trigger frenzy mode now, nothing will happen..."
,"Try activating it in the daytime!"
"#01835","You can register your yearly score on the rankings board."
,"Let's try really hard to get a high score!"
"#01836","Ohohohoho!"
,"You feel you're ready to face one of my missions? I designed them myself you know, I haven't slept for weeks."
,"If you clear a mission, I might give you a nice little bonus. Something I made with my own two hands."
,"You can do three missions a day. They're very useful, you should try some!"
"#01837","Aha! It's finally time for a mission I see! Very well, let's do it!"
,"The mission starts...now!"
"#01838","Let's see what events we have to choose from this season!"
"#01839","Let's see, how many events are we having this season... It appears we have <0> this time.<br>I hope things run smoothly and have the effect we're hoping for!"
"#01840","Construction on your extension has begun."
,"The platform is being built, but, it's going to take a while..."
,"If you tap the clock icon, the construction will be finished almost instantaneously!"
,"...Doing that will cost you coins though, and it looks like you don't have any..."
,"Oh, come to think of it, I found this stuck to my forehead a little while ago... Here have it!"
"#01841","The construction on your expansion has begun."
"#01842","Let's fix up a train!"
,"Tap a train and select <co=0070c0>Edit Train</co>."
"#01843","Which platform do you want this route to run to?"
"#01844","OK! Your item is equipped!"
,"Be sure to set <co=0070c0>equippable items</co> onto facilities whenever you get them!"
"#01845","One of your <co=0070c0>customers</co> has reached the <co=0070c0>level cap</co>."
,"Let's try raising their level cap using some <pic=lamp>!"
,"Choose the person whose level you wish to raise."
,"Ah, those <pic=lamp> you just found? I've secretly been hoarding them for a moment like this... Use them!"
"#01846","Let's improve this customer's level even more!"
"#01847","It's a new day..."
,"...the mission you were working on has ended."
,"But, don't be downhearted!<br>Let's just take on one of today's missions instead!"
"#01848","Yes, hello... Welcome to my glorious emporium..."
,"Right now we have an item shop and a coin shop."
,"Just this once I'll let you have something, on the house... What would you like?"
"#01849","Thank you for your patronage... Do you need anything else?"
"#01850","Heh heh heh. Thank you... Do come again..."
"#01851","You've obtained an item!<br>Please check the item box for more information."
"#01852","You've decided not to hold any seasonal events."
"#01853","There don't seem to be any facilities you can install right now."
,"If the population of the town increases and the town level rises then..."
,"...the <co=0070c0>number of facilities</co> you can build will also increase!"
,"If you want to install more things, we should encourage<co=0070c0> population growth</co>!"
"#01854","Let's set a route in the empty slot!"
"#01855","You've switched the floor display.<br>When it's difficult to see, or you want to switch floors..."
,"...try tapping these buttons."
,"So, let's try it one more time!<br>Switch which floor is showing!"
"#01856","You've switched the floor display."
,"Please take advantage of this in the future."
"#01857","You've started a research project!<br>Now all you have to do is wait for it to finish!"
"#01858","You can now change the game speed."
,"Tap the general settings in the menu, and try <co=0070c0>increasing the speed </co>of the game!"
"#01859","Excuse me..."
,"I feel like the station gateways are a little small, maybe it's time for an upgrade."
,"But, when we make it bigger, some of the surrounding facilities might get demolished."
,"If that happens, I'm sorry!<br>If you need anything building in the future, please do call anytime!"
"#01860","Ooh, a mysterious customer has come to check out your station!"
,"Maybe if they like what they see, they will come again!"
,"I do hope they'll like it here!"
"#01861","I've had a look around the station, but it's not for me as it is right now..."
,"I look forward to your future developments, so maybe I will come back...someday."
"#01862","The platform here is a little small.<br>Let's extend it so that we can make our station building super-extra-awesome."
,"Select to extend the platform from the Develop menu."
"#01863","Hello!"
,"Everybody is talking about my up-and-coming station!"
,"I m-mean OUR station...<br>Hey, why don't you consider connecting the ""Lazydays Local Line""?"
,"Please consider how to make the best use of us going forward."
"#01864","Finally! You can now connect even more routes!"
,"Let's add more station buildings!"
,"Expanding the station is so much fun!<br>I'm so excited, I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight!"
,"Zzzzzz......"
"#01865","I've been looking into what we need to do to expand our station even further..."
,"Then I remembered that in the manual the former assistant left, it said we should establish a research department."
,"So, let's invite some researchers here right away, and push for some research to help the station!"
"#01866","The tenant has settled in with no issues!<br>Let's hope for future success!"
"#01867","You've extended the platform but...<br>That train looks a little lonely now..."
,"Don't worry! I've called in some favors, and got us permission to build longer trains!"
,"Let's create a train befitting of our station!"
"#01868","Oh, wow..."
,"You know the routes that run through our station?"
,"...I got permission to change them!<br>But, there may be significant changes in the customer base and the number of visitors."
,"Why don't you try connecting the route that you like most?"
"#01869","This morning while I was brushing my teeth, something occurred to me..."
,"Targeting customers is a great way to get <co=0070c0>even more customers</co> to come to your station."
,"So, let's pick a target and aim to manage our customer base more."
,"I've prepared the<co=0070c0> target change menu</co> for you. Give it a go!"
"#01870","A customer was so happy, they've given you a present!"
,"Oh, something else seems to have been dropped, too..."
"#01871","Oh look, you've found an item!"
,"Well, until you know what it does, why not just try using it!"
,"I'm like that with loyalty cards! I just wave it at the shop assistant and wait to see what happens."
,"Anyway, let's check out your item box, you can select it from the menu."
"#01872","The shop I contacted the other day has finally opened! You should definitely stop by for a quick look!"
"#01873","Hey, I've discovered a special way for you to get coins for free!"
,"For some reason, if you install other great apps, then..."
,"Oh, it's written here, but I've forgotten my glasses, so I can't read it very well..."
,"Anyway, you can check it out yourself in the menu!"
"#01874","Look! It seems a notice board has opened where you can find all sorts of hints and tips."
,"If you have something you want to know, it might be a good idea to have a look at it!"
"#01875","Now we have a bit more space, let's not dillydally and install a <co=0070c0>kiosk</co> right away!"
"#01876","The National Train Association says..."
,"Today's missions have been announced!"
,"My grandfather, the chairman, said that we could get incredible rewards for completing them."
,"So we should definitely try one!"
"#01877","We've been working so hard to improve the station..."
,"...let's sit back and watch the customers for a little while."
"#01878","Oh, one of your items looks like it can be equipped!"
,"If you tap the <co=0070c0>magnifying glass icon </co>that appears when you touch a facility, it will bring up to the equipment screen."
,"Let's improve our facilities!"
"#01879","I feel like we've completed the first stage of a long journey..."
,"Next time, if we have spare gold, we should extend the platform or..."
,"...install some more facilities!<br>Either way, let's continue to develop our station!"
"#01880","It seems that a certain famous shop has finally opened!"
,"I'm really looking forward to finally meeting Mr. Pumpkin!"
,"I wonder, does he really wear a pumpkin on his head?"
"#01881","The research is going well...<br>We've already unlocked all kinds of facilities!"
,"We could invest in trains or new infrastructure or..."
,"You know, let's just do research everywhere!"
,"By they way, I got these from the former assistant, I forgot to give them to you..."
,"Here, take them!"
"#01882","This platform is getting nicer and nicer!"
,"A long train would be able to fit here if we just..."
,"...ordered some extension work!"
"#01883","All the applications for the position of researcher have been gathered..."
,"Did you know that a researcher's special skill affects their contributions to the improvement of the station?"
,"So, when<co=366092> changing researchers</co>, please consider your options carefully!"
"#01884","Hello!<br>Thank you for choosing to connect to our route!"
,"I hope it serves you well for many years to come!"

,"Why don't you add another floor? Then you could develop even further!"
,"Seeing as I've taken the trouble to send you this mail, you should at least have a look! Ohohohoho!"
"#01902","It's time to collect the usage fees."
"#01903","It's 17:00."
"#01904","It's time to collect rent."
"#01905","The day has come to an end."
"#01906","Spring has sprung!"

"#01907","Summer is here!"
"#01908","Fall has fell."
"#01909","Winter is coming."
"#01910","Soon the year will be at an end."
"#01911","Your coins seem to be running low..."

,"Oh no!"
,"I'm sorry!<br>I forgot, I bought a double chocolate mochafrappelatte earlier..."
,"I'm really am so sorry..."
"#01912","Your amount of <pic=lamp> isn't looking too healthy..."

"#01920","A new platform has been built!"
,"Trains won't arrive at this platform until you set a route."
,"So, tap the new platform!"
"#01921","Some new floor space has been built!"
,"Trains won't stop here...<br>But, there's plenty of space to install lots of facilities!"
,"Let's construct some right away!"
"#01922","Your platform has been extended!<br>Now even longer trains can arrive here."
,"Let's make one of our trains longer!"
"#01923","Excuse me..."
,"When I was continuing the expansion of your station, I noticed there was just enough space to add an extra <co=0070c0>entrance</co>."
,"So I built one! It should make passing through the station a lot smoother for the customers!"
,"See you later..."
"#01924","Oho! I see you've finally added a new floor!"
,"But, you really should hurry up and add some stairs!"
"#01925","Hello!<br>I'm a representative from the Every Streetlight Line!"

,"I implore you to consider our proposal."
"#01926","Hello!<br>I'm a representative from the Oval Link Metro Line!"
,"This really is turning into a place worthy of rumor... So, I would like to connect our route with your station."
,"I implore you to consider our proposal."
"#01927","It looks like there is a facility that is difficult to access."
,"That means the customers can't get in to spend money!"
,"We need to move it!<br>Tap the facility and <co=0070c0>move it using the pink arrow</co>."
"#01928","You've built some stairs!<br>Now people can go between floors as they please!"
,"If you want to install some more, have your researchers<co=0070c0> increase the number available</co>."
"#01929","You've built an escalator!<br>Now it's much more pleasant for customers to travel between floors!"
"#01930","You've built an elevator!<br>Your customers are really happy!"
"#01931","For some reason, there appears to be a change in one of your customers..."
"#01932","A customer has reached level <co=0070c0>5</co>!"

,"Let's check your target customers and do that right away!"
"#01933","A customer has reached level 20!"
,"You're making a lot of progress!<br>It seems they will do a lot more shopping now, let's watch them from now on!"
"#01934","A customer has reached level 30!"
"#01935","A customer has reached level 50!"
"#01936","A customer has reached level 99!"

,"But don't despair!<br>There are still plenty of customers you can guide to their maximum potential!"
"#01937","Whoa! Somebody new has moved here to this town."
,"These settlers...<br>They seem to contribute to the sales of tickets!"

"#01938","Over 10 people have moved to your town!"
"#01939","I have been hearing rumors about an excellent station..."

"#01944","You've made a customer so happy..."
,"...that they've said that they want to work at <station> Station!"
,"They might come in handy when it's time to do some research. I wonder what their special skill is..."
"#01945","The number of potential researchers has increased quite a lot!"
,"Seeing as each researcher's special skill is different, you should consider <co=0070c0>changing your researcher</co>!"
,"You can also change your researcher when there's nothing left to research, you know."
"#01946","The number of potential researchers has increased!"
,"Why don't you try leveling up some of your researchers?"
,"If you do, their special skill could also improve. So you should really try it!"
"#01947","I have been hearing rumors about an excellent station..."

"#01958","I think I see a customer going out through the ticket gate. Do you see them?"
,"When this happens, the town's <co=0070c0>population increases</co>!"
,"I guess customers who are happy with the station facilities will take root in the town."
,"In that case... Let's aim to make this place the happiest place in town!"
"#01959","A customer is heading out of the ticket gates and into the town..."
,"That's our 50th customer, now!"
,"If we improve the quality of our facilities, more customers will be happy... Then maybe they will stay here!"
"#01960","I have been hearing rumors about an excellent station..."

"#03360","▼ Station Manager<br>This is a simulation game in which you develop your very own train stations.<br>You can build a huge variety of trains and facilities, letting you create amazing stations that brings a smile to everybody in the land.<br>Once you've built up one station, you can change maps and start creating another. Challenge yourself, aim to get the high score, and take 1st place in the rankings!"
"#03361","▼ The Flow of the Game<br>Start by setting up facilities on your platform. Then, when it's starting to feel a little cramped, extend the platform and spread out. If you feel like your trains are too short, you can lengthen them by adding more cars. You can also expand by building extra platforms.<br>If you install high-quality facilities, you could become a major station that hordes of customers come to visit."
"#03362","▼ Your Station<br>Aim to build a station that lots of people will want to visit. For starters, watch out for the number and quality of the installed facilities, as these are likely to have a positive influence on customers.<br>If the quality of your facilities is high, the town's population will increase, which is advantageous to the development of your station. Look at customer trends and develop your station accordingly."
"#03363","▼ Your Trains<br>The trains that your customers will ride on are very important to the development of your station.<br><br>Speed - The speed at which the train cars move.<br>Passengers - The number of passengers a train car can carry.<br>Frequency - The time between trains on this route.<br>Customer base - Changes the age range, number, and type of passengers who visit your station.<br><br>The routes than run through your station will also affect these parameters. Matching train cars together will give you a bonus to the frequency of that train."
"#03364","▼ Routes<br>If you match your train cars, it will have an effect on the customer base and the frequency of the trains. There are underground and overground routes, so make sure to match the routes with the location.<br>Accumulate route points through investment in infrastructure research. When you install new trains and replace cars the fares will rise, as will the sales of tickets.<br>Also, if you run the same route for a long time, it will enhance the value of specialty products throughout the station, and will also have a positive effect on seasonal events."
"#03365","▼ Fares<br>Customer ticket sales grow with the fares. For example, installing a facility on platform 1 will increase the maximum fare for that platform.<br>As the passenger fare increases, the number of people using trains departing from that platform to get to distant stations will do too, and so will sales in general.<br>There is also a special facility that will increase the overall passenger fare of the station regardless of where it is installed. Fares also vary by route, and might also change with the addition of new train cars."
"#03366","▼ Facilities 1<br>Facilities are an important element to remember when you are outfitting your station, especially for growing your customer base.<br>How well a facility matches with the surrounding area significantly changes the ability of customers to use a facility. If a facility becomes difficult to access, for example if there is no space to pass in front of it, then the customers' ability to use that facility will decrease.<br>A tenant is necessary to open a shop, and if the quality of the facility is high, a superior tenant may apply. You can unlock new facilities through research."
"#03367","▼ Facilities 2<br>Once a certain number of customers use a facility, it will level up. There are also items that raise the level of the facility directly.<br>Equipping items will have a positive effect on the facility's sales and customer happiness. Also, If you are developing another map at the same time, you will receive some of the takings from your other station's facilities.<br>Equipping items can increase the amount of money you can receive from a facility."
"#03368","▼ Facility Parameters<br>Specialty Products - Customers will be attracted to your station by facilities which stock their favorite products. The more facilities with that product in your station, the easier it will be to attract customers who like it.<br>Quality - Influences how attracted customers are to a facility and the happiness they gain from it.<br>Stock - The number of customers that can use a facility per month.<br>Rent - The amount facilities pay every month.<br>Capacity - How much a facility needs to earn for you to collect gold and research points.<br>Equipment slots - These differ by facility. You should aim to fill these slots as quickly as possible, as equipment has no maintenance costs and also cost nothing to move. They also have an effect on the value of specialty products of each map."
"#03369","▼ Facility Matching<br>Certain facilities have a good influence on the facilities they are installed next to.<br>Sometimes, when a facility is placed next to a ""matching"" installation, that facility will see its parameters improve dramatically.<br>There could be times when installations are not a good match, again depending on where they are installed. In those instances, it is suggested that you move the facility."
"#03370","▼ Time-designated Events<br>00:00 - New month starts<br>03:00 - Facilities restock<br>05:00 - <pic=lamp> collection<br>12:00 - Seasonal events start<br>15:00 - Research update<br>15:00 - Usage fees collection<br>22:00 - Usage fees collection<br>23:00 - Rent collection<br>24:00 - Customer headcount"
"#03371","▼ Customers 1<br>Customers who get off the trains that arrive at your station will use the facilities you install, and when they are happy, they will head into town. People will also come from the town and buy a ticket to ride the train elsewhere. A customer's ability and speed will increase in their favorite season. When a customer reaches level 5, you will need to increase their level cap to level them up further. There are many types of customers of all ages who love riding the train. Try appealing to a wide demographic to encourage more customers to come to your station."
"#03372","▼ Customers 2<br>The more facilities you have, the more customers will ride the train. What's more, the higher the average quality of those facilities, the more people will alight the train at your station. The wider the customer base able to arrive on your trains, the more likely you are to discover new customers. If the quality of the type of facility a customer likes is high, they will be encouraged to visit your station.<br>* The more of a customer's favorite type of facility you have, the easier it will be to make them happy."
"#03373","▼ Customer Parameters<br>Likes - This represents which type of facility a customer will be enticed by. It also has an effect on their happiness.<br>EXP - This is necessary for a customer to level up<br>Assets - Mainly used when calculating rank.<br>Gold - What customers spend to use facilities. They go home once it reaches zero.<br>Energy - This goes down as a customer uses facilities. They go home once it reaches zero.<br>Happiness - This accumulates as a customer uses facilities. They gain 1 EXP when they reach their happiness quotient."
"#03374","▼ Special Customers<br>If you invest in the infrastructure of the local area, you might discover special customers. After you discover a special customer, they will occasionally explore your station and ride the train. These special customers can also be chosen as target customers, gain EXP, and level up.<br>As many of these customers have higher attributes, you should try and help them grow as much as possible. You can also discover new special customers during each seasonal event."
"#03375","▼ Customer Level<br>Customers set as targets will gain EXP and level up when they are happy with the quality of the facilities.<br>The more gold and energy a customer has, the longer they will stay in your station. When a customer levels up, they may wish to become a researcher, and settle in your town. Make sure you try leveling different types of customers."
"#03376","▼ Customer Survey Targets<br>If you set a customer as a target, you can see what they will need to make them happy. Once they are happy, you will receive <pic=lamp>. The trick is to set the customers who frequently visit your station as your survey targets. Also, customers are easier to keep happy during their favorite season, so be sure to change your targets accordingly."
"#03377","▼ Research<br>You can hire customers to research the following:<br>1. Facilities<br>2. Train cars<br>3. Infrastructure<br><br>Researchers you hire each have a special skill, so you should check before researching anything what effects you want, and hire accordingly.<br>You can level up your researcher with items."
"#03378","▼ Infrastructure Investments<br>There are times when researching can lead to large population growth. You will also accumulate route points which will unlock new train routes. Depending on the circumstances, you might also discover special customers. You can check the value of your specialty products on the infrastructure investments screen. In the beginning, each map will have different specialty product values, but this will change once you connect new routes."
"#03379","▼ Items<br>Using items can be a way to obtain coins and gold, and they can also have various effects when equipped to facilities.<br>You can buy more items in the shop, so don't hesitate to equip the ones you have. If you still have a surplus of items, you can use them to level up your researchers."
"#03380","▼ Maps<br>Each map has its own set of challenges, including area size. So there's something for everyone when developing.<br>Which routes you can unlock depends on location, and there are times when different customers will appear, too.<br>Aim to be number one on every map!"
"#03381","▼ Managing Other Stations<br>In addition to the station you are currently developing, you will periodically receive up to 40% of the takings from your other stations.<br>The stations you are not currently developing will not change anything about themselves while you are gone.<br>If you equip more items on your facilities, you will receive a larger percentage of its earnings.<br>Seasonal events you started while on a certain map will continue once you return to them."
"#03382","▼ Yearly Rankings<br>Sales, number of visitors, population growth, customer assets, and happiness levels will all contribute to the yearly ranking of your station.<br>Try and develop your station and progress up the ranks to number 1 on each map.<br>You get rewards based on the rank you achieve. You may also unlock new maps if you rank high enough!"
"#03383","▼ Missions<br>New missions will appear every day, and completing them will earn you big bonuses.<br>You can attempt 3 missions a day, so if you still have missions left to try, you might as well have a go. What have you got to lose?"
"#03384","▼ Seasonal Events<br>You can choose to enter these events at the start of each season. The higher the value of your current specialty products, the more customers might come to your station during the event. Special customers may come to check out your station during this time, so you should try to have seasonal events as often as you can! You have a chance to collect a bonus each season, but there may be times when you earn over the specified amount of light bulb points and you aren't awarded a bonus."
"#03385","▼ Ticket Gates<br>There are times when the population of your town increases and construction occurs to enlarge your ticket gates.<br>These expansions may demolish existing facilities, so please be careful. There may also be researchers who can make these expansions happen earlier.<br>Happy customers who leave through your ticket gates will contribute to an increase in the population of your town."
"#03386","▼ Seasonal Matching<br>Both customers and facilities have seasons that they prefer. In their favorite season, customers walk faster and are easier to make happy. If you set a customer as your target demographic during their favorite season, you will earn lots of points.<br>When a new season arrives, the quality of facilities that match that season increases. Also, customers will be more easily enticed by a facility that matches the season, and will be more likely to be happier when using it."
"#03387","▼ Frenzy<br>Your frenzy gauge fills as you install facilities. Activating frenzy mode will bring a lot of customers to your station.<br>It will also be easier to earn light bulb points and gold while in frenzy mode.<br>After activating frenzy mode, for a little while, if you continue installing the same facility, the frenzy gauge will be harder to fill. <br>Participating in seasonal events will also help fill the frenzy gauge."
"#03388","▼ In-app Purchases<br>The following features can be unlocked through in-app purchases:<br>・Fast mode<br>・Map restarts<br>・Facility level-up items<br>・Customer level-up items"
"#03389","▼ In-app Purchases<br>The following items can also be unlocked through in-app purchases: <br>・Facility level-up items<br>・Customer level-up items<br>You can also purchase these items using in-game currency such as coins."
