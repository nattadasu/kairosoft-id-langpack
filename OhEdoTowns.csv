"#01033","Newspaper (1st Issue)"
"#01034","Greetings. This ""newspaper"" is a new innovation that will keep people informed about news from around the country, including the latest gossip about feudal lords. Now for the news... <0> is a new domain near Edo that has been granted special permission by the government to experiment with commercial development. We look forward to seeing how it goes. There's no castle there yet, but it's just a matter of time."
"#01035","An Earthquake Strikes"
"#01036","An earthquake struck <0> recently. While it wasn't a large one, one resident did mention dropping a teacup in shock when it hit. Earthquakes can destroy houses or cause fires, so it's important to be prepared for natural disasters."
"#01037","School Construction"
"#01038","It seems that a school has been built in <0>. ""I can't wait to start studying!"" said one local resident enthusiastically. Building a school has a positive effect on the entire town, increasing the Intelligence and Loyalty of its residents. But it should be placed in an accessible location. Rumor has it that the national government even gives prizes for academic achievement."
"#01039","A Sumo Ring Appears"
"#01040","Sumo remains a popular diversion in the Edo area, with a new ring recently appearing in <0>. It's all the residents can talk about, with some of the children saying they want to be wrestlers when they grow up. It should also attract visitors to the area."
"#01041","Plenty of Fresh Veggies"
"#01042","A vegetable stand has appeared in <0>. ""We've got only the freshest vegetables! These daikon radishes are great in oden stew!"" said the proprietor, perhaps hinting at the optimal placement of his cart. With the trend for healthy eating that's sweeping Edo, this store is sure to be a popular one."
"#01043","Wholesalers"
"#01044","A merchant moving to the agricultural domain of <0> has introduced a wholesaler to the area, which should help form the basis of a retail industry. ""Now I have a place to work,"" exclaimed a local artisan. Indeed, it may attract a variety of artisans and merchants. In honor of this achievement, the national government has awarded the domain <2> <1> Research Points."
"#01045","Townspeople"
"#01046","A recent survey by the national government gives us a glimpse into the lives of the common man. First, it seems that people tend to frequent stores or workplaces that are connected to their houses by roads. Higher Loyalty means that people work harder and have nicer houses. And while there is a limit to how far they can go on foot, they can go quite far on horseback. Perhaps this information will come in handy during future town planning."
"#01047","5th Anniversary"
"#01048","It's hard to believe it has been 5 years since the birth of <0>. Its population has swelled to <1> hardworking residents. ""There are still many undeveloped areas, so we've got a lot of work to do,"" said one resident enthusiastically. In honor of this occasion, the national government has given the domain a cash award, which will hopefully stimulate further growth."
"#01049","8th Anniversary"
"#01050","8 years have passed since <0> was created. One of the first residents commented: ""This place sure has changed since the old days. Why, that house there used to be just a dirty little hut!"" In recognition of <0>'s steady growth, the national government has given the domain a special cash award."
"#01051","12th Anniversary"
"#01052","<0> has reached its 12th anniversary. ""<0> is amazing. I hope we can be half as successful,"" said the leader of a younger domain enviously. The national government appears to have recognized <0>'s achievements as well, giving the domain a special cash award."
"#01053","20th Anniversary"
"#01054","<0>'s growth shows no signs of stopping. Indeed, it has even attracted attention from overseas, where woodblock prints from <0> command high prices. ""I'd like to visit someday. It's too bad the country is closed off,"" said one merchant from Shanghai. In honor of the domain's continued success, the national government has given it a special cash award."

"#01056","<0> has reached its 50th anniversary! The area's development is impressive, with <1> residents and a large number of available crafts. Some have even broached the topic of moving the national government to <0>. Perhaps in reaction to this, the national government reduced its usual cash award to the domain..."
"#01057","99th Anniversary"
"#01058","Incredibly, 99 years have passed since the inception of <0>. ""Thank you for playing our game for so long,"" said Mister X mysteriously. ""We hope you'll let us know what you think of the game, and tell your friends about it too."" "
"#01059","A New Craft"
"#01060","<0> now has its first local craft. The finished products show the skill of the local artisans, and have attracted attention from nearby domains. And if a usage fee is paid, the completed craft can be used on residents or stores to provide special effects. We can't help but wonder what kind of crafts will come out of this domain in the future. Hopefully they will use the cash award given by the national government to fund further research."
"#01061","A New Public Bath"
"#01062","<0> now features a public bath, complete with a scenic open-air section. The hot water helps to ease the fatigue of the local farmers and increase their Appeal. ""This is great,"" said one resident. ""Now I just have to save up for a new bucket!"""
"#01063","New Craft Discovered"
"#01064","Word has it that <0> came up with the plans for a new craft after finishing work at a local wholesaler. ""It just came to me,"" they said, recalling the incident. ""I went right to work making it."" When an artisan enters a wholesaler, they may sometimes invent new crafts. And depending on the surrounding buildings, they may even discover some very special crafts."
"#01065","A High-Yield Field"
"#01066","""Yield"" is used to measure the value of buildings or houses, and <0> now has a <1> with a Yield exceeding 80. ""Come to think of it, the harvest has been good recently,"" commented a local farmer happily. One easy way to boost Yield is to plant trees near a building, and it seems that some buildings will complement each other when built nearby."
"#01067","Castle Complete"
"#01068","<0> now has a castle, making it a proper domain at last. ""Now I can change jobs,"" said one resident. ""I want to try lots of different jobs and build myself a nice house."" Castles can boost the Yield of buildings in quite a wide radius around them, so building near the castle can be a shortcut toward boosting your overall Yield."
"#01069","Stone Paths"
"#01070","Town planners in <0> have started using stone paths. When asked for a comment, one merchant said that stone paths in front of his store helped boost his Yield. You can even build new paths right over existing ones. Convenient, isn't it?"
"#01071","Room at the Inn"
"#01072","An Inn has been built in <0>. Inns are places where travelers from all around the country can stay. The domain's fledgling Board of Tourism has been flooded with inquiries. ""At last we can visit <0>!"" said one prospective visitor. ""I can't wait to see what they have to offer!"""
"#01073","A New Horse"
"#01074","<1> the <0> is the first in town to buy a horse. ""I've always wanted to ride a horse,"" said the proud owner, smiling. ""Now I can visit places that are quite far away."" Seeing the galloping horse, other residents indicated their intention to save up for a mount of their own."
"#01075","Insufficient Wholesalers"
"#01076","""We need a wholesaler!"" said a merchant in <0>. Merchants make money by working at wholesalers, so without one they will be in dire financial straits. If you have the funds, try selecting ""Build"" from the menu and building a Wholesaler. It's sure to result in increased growth in your domain."
"#01077","Encouraging Growth"
"#01078","Here's good news for anyone having trouble growing their domains. It seems that increasing the number of ""combos"" is the key. Combos are groups of compatible buildings or facilities. You can see some possible combos by selecting ""Economy"" > ""Combo List"" from the menu. They can boost Yield and even increase store prices. The national government has sent cash awards to each domain to encourage combo development."
"#01079","Mastering a Job"
"#01080","We have just learned that <0> has become a level 5 <1>. As a resident's job level increases, so does the Yield of their house, and their income. Once a resident has reached the maximum level in one job, you might try switching them to another one. By the way, it seems that job level increases little by little as residents visit various stores."
"#01081","A Smart Resident"
"#01082","According to our sources, <0>'s Intelligence has reached 45. ""I've been studying various subjects while I'm shopping,"" they were heard to comment, with an intelligent smile. As residents' abilities increase, they can make new discoveries and contribute to the development of the town. Residents' abilities can also be boosted by placing certain buildings near their homes."
"#01083","The Effects of Loyalty"
"#01084","<0>'s Loyalty has increased recently, according to reports. ""I've just been feeling like I should work hard for the good of the domain,"" they said while taking a rest from weaving straw hats at home. ""Residents with high Loyalty work harder, and have more money and bigger homes. Try placing buildings that boost loyalty next to the homes of residents who aren't giving their best."
"#01085","An Appealing Resident"
"#01086","According to our sources, <0> has become quite appealing recently. ""Why does everybody want to talk to me...?"" said the attractive resident in an oddly appealing tone as our reporter followed them home. ""I like being popular, but this is a bit too much!"""
"#01087","An Inspired Resident"
"#01088","Everyone seems to be talking about how skilled <0> is. ""I've been getting the best ideas in my sleep recently. But I keep oversleeping! I was late for work again yesterday!"" said the resident sleepily. The higher a resident's Skill, the more likely they are to have success when creating crafts, so highly skilled residents are best suited to be artisans."
"#01089","A Warrior Appears"
"#01090","A warrior has appeared in <0>. ""Warriors are pretty versatile--you definitely need guys like me,"" said the warrior, <1>. ""We warriors work in castles, but we can also work in the fields if it's too far away."" In honor of the warrior's appearance, the national government has given the domain a special cash award."
"#01091","Bean Jam Buns"
"#01092","<0>'s Yield has reached 100,000. In honor of the achievement, officials from the nearby Saitama Domain have sent a gift of the domain's specially made bean jam buns. ""Congratulations,"" read the included note. ""Try our buns--they're amazing."""
"#01093","In the Top 80"
"#01094","According to a recent national survey, <0> is one of the top 80 domains in Total Yield. ""Never heard of the place,"" commented an official from another domain. ""But with such a small Yield, I guess it's not surprising. They'll probably be at the bottom of the list next year."" Officials from a nearby domain have sent some Sunflowers in honor of the achievement."
"#01095","=MID(#01093,1,-2)&'50'"
"#01096","According to a recent national survey, <0> is one of the top 50 domains in Total Yield. ""We made it into the top 50?!"" cried one resident. ""I know we have a long way to go, but... Woohoo!"" A nearby domain sent some beautiful Hydrangeas in honor of the achievement."
"#01097","=MID(#01093,1,-2)&'30'"
"#01098","According to a recent national survey, <0> is one of the top 30 domains in Total Yield. This achievement seems to have brought them some degree of notoriety. ""<0>? Of course, I've heard of it. I'd like to visit someday,"" said an official at another domain. A large decorative boulder was delivered from a nearby domain in honor of the achievement."
"#01099","=MID(#01093,1,-2)&'10'"
"#01100","According to a recent national survey, <0> is now one of the top 10 domains in terms of Total Yield. ""So they made it into the top 10, eh?"" said a leading figure in the national government. ""I guess it was worth supporting them all this time. An impressive Gingko Tree was delivered from a nearby domain in honor of the achievement."
"#01101","Top of the Heap"
"#01102","According to a recent national survey, <0> is the top ranking domain in the country. ""It's an incredible achievement,"" said the Shogun. ""Perhaps I really should move the government to <0>..."" A foreign country sent a rare Banana Tree to the domain in recognition of its amazing growth."
"#01103","Gravel Paths & Houses"
"#01104","<0> now has the ability to build Gravel Paths, which are popular with homeowners. ""I don't know why, but it just feels different,"" said one resident. ""I hope they'll put gravel in front of my house."" Indeed, putting gravel in front of a house will increase its Yield. Stating that roads are the basis for a strong economy, the national government sent along a cash award to be used to improve the domain's infrastructure."
"#01105","Building Warehouses"
"#01106","<0> can now build Warehouses, which are critical for commerce. Warehouses help stimulate commercial development and can greatly increase the Yield of nearby stores. However, because each Warehouse requires considerable effort to build, each one built will increase the cost of subsequent ones. Think carefully about where to place them."
"#01107","Many Artisans"
"#01108","The population of artisans in <0> has now reached 5. Artisans from around the country are talking favorably about the domain, with some even considering moving there."
"#01109","Many Merchants"
"#01110","The population of merchants in <0> has now reached 5. Merchants from around the country are talking favorably about the domain, with some even considering moving there."
"#01111","Many Warriors"
"#01112","The population of warriors in <0> has now reached 5. Warriors from around the country are talking favorably about the domain, with some even considering moving there."
"#01113","Many Vassals"
"#01114","The population of vassals in <0> has now reached 5. Vassals from around the country are talking favorably about the domain, with some even considering moving there."
"#01115","On a White Horse"
"#01116","<1> the <0> has reportedly purchased a snow-white horse. ""Now this is more like it,"" said the proud owner on horseback. ""I'm glad I became a warrior."" When asked for comment, the stable master indicated that he occasionally sells white horses to the most powerful warriors."
"#01117","A Marvel of Technology"
"#01118","<1> the <0> has been sighted riding in something called ""automobile.""||""Horses are so last century,"" commented the resident, rolling down the vehicle's windows. When asked for comment, the stable master said, ""They invented these horseless carriages overseas, so I figured I might as well try selling them alongside the horses."""
"#01119","A Vassal Appears"
"#01120","<0> has seen the appearance of its first vassal. The vassal, <1>, said, ""Thank you for taking the time to train us so thoroughly. We vassals are rather talented, so we may make some interesting discoveries..."" The national government sent along a generous cash award in honor of the achievement."
"#01121","A Spirit of the Forest"
"#01122","There have been reports of a fierce bear being sighted in the deep forest. Eyewitnesses said that it left in the direction of <0>. Authorities advise that giving the bear a place to live is the best way to deal with it."
"#01128","Another Castle"
"#01129","The national government has announced that all domains in the top 60 of the recent Yield Survey will be given permission to construct castles. ""Yes!"" commented one excited official. ""We built our castle in the wrong place the first time, but now can build another and do it right!"""
"#01130","Yet Another Castle"
"#01131","The national government has announced that all domains in the top 20 of the recent Yield Survey will be given permission to construct castles. ""Excellent,"" commented one official happily. ""We'll use this as a stepping-stone to help us reach number one!"""
"#01132","Thatched Houses"
"#01133","<0> has recently remodeled their house. ""I think I've got the nicest house in town now,"" commented the resident. ""I hired the best carpenters in the area, you know."" According to our research, when residents save enough money, they will automatically remodel their houses. The other residents are no doubt already planning their own improvements."
